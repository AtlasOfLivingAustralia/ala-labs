Australia's flora and fauna have adapted alongside fire, with some plants [needing fire to germinate and regenerate](https://www.dbca.wa.gov.au/wildlife-and-ecosystems/fire-and-environment/fire-plants-and-vegetation).\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have also expertly [used fire for tens of thousands of years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718521000233) to [care for Country](https://www.bushheritage.org.au/what-we-do/our-challenge/fire-management), managing vegetation, reducing wildfire risk, and fostering biodiversity. Since European colonisation, however, the disruption of these practices has created a [build-up of fuel loads](https://wwf.org.au/blogs/new-study-confirms-indigenous-fire-management-equals-success/) and introduced invasive plant species, increasing Australia's risk of larger, uncontrollable fires as temperatures rise.\n\nIn 2019-2020, Australia experienced one of the most catastrophic bushfire seasons on record. Fires burnt approximately [19 million hectares](https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/australian-bushfires/), of which 12.6 million were primarily forest and bushland. An estimated [900 species](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08174-6) of plants and animals were severely impacted, and [3 billion animals were killed or displaced](https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/australian-bushfires/).\n\nIn this post we will explore the impact of the 2019-2020 bushfires on a population of greater gliders (*Petauroides volans*), a forest-dwelling marsupial species found along the east coast of Australia. We'll determine greater gliders' overall habitat range using [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and [tidysdm](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/), then use the output of our model to explore whether the impact of fire on greater glider observations since 2019-2020.\n\nTo begin, we can load the following packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels) \nlibrary(tidysdm) # devtools::install_github(\"EvolEcolGroup/tidysdm\")\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyterra)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ozmaps)\nlibrary(elevatr)\nlibrary(geodata)\nlibrary(stacks)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe are interested in testing whether observations of gliders changed in areas burnt by the 2019/2020 Black Summer bushfires compared to those that remained unburnt.\n\nThat means we'll need a few components for our investigation:\n\n-   Data of greater glider observations made before and after the fires\n-   Environmental variables that determine greater gliders' likely habitat range\n-   The extent of area burnt by the 2019-2020 bushfires\n\nOur hypothesised effect is that there are *fewer* occurrences of greater gliders after the fire, and a driver of this effect is that *an area was previously burnt* during the 2019/2020 bushfires.\n\nFirst, let's establish our study area and download records of our species of interest.\n\n# Download data\n\n## Observational data\n\nThe Southern Greater Glider (*Petauroides volans*) is Australia’s largest gliding marsupial, found in tall eucalypt forests along the east coast, from Queensland to Victoria. They are an endagered nocturnal, tree-dwelling herbivore that primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves and den in hollow bear trees[^1].\n\n[^1]: Southern greater gliders grow up to 1m long from head to tail and can glide up to 100 metres through the canopy!\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"}\n<img src=\"https://ala-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/store/2/1/0/8/e0bec186-b95a-4a50-8ce3-824143268012/original\" class=\"rounded\"/></img>\n\n<img src=\"https://ala-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/store/c/4/c/e/a0428bcf-f667-4f43-80b5-5ba1dc40ec4c/original\" class=\"rounded\"/></img>\n:::\n\n::: figure-caption\nLeft: [*Petauroides volans* (Josh Bowell \\| CC-BY-NC 3.0 (Au))](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/fde509c4-f493-46fc-9ae5-bab9fe2fc621), Right: [*Petauroides volans* (David Sinnott \\| CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int))](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/65b74308-6e20-40f1-ac34-0b8f65a468bd)\n:::\n\nWe're going to focus on a region of South-East New South Wales and the Australian Captial Territory for our investigation.

With the help of previous studies on gliders[^2], we've chosen to download the following four raster layers[^3] to use as environmental predictors in our species distribution model:\n\n[^2]: e.g. [Smith et al. 2007](https://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/WR06063); [Ridley et al. 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aec.13582)\n\n[^3]: For more info about what rasters are, see the [\"What's a raster\" section from this ALA Labs article](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2024-04-30_sdm-tidymodels/#download-environmental-data).\n\n1.  Elevation (from the [elevatr package](https://github.com/USEPA/elevatr))\n2.  Tree cover (from [Global Land Analysis & Discovery](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/global-2010-tree-cover-30-m))\n3.  Mean annual temperature (BIO1) (from [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/))\n4.  Annual precipitation (BIO12) (from [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/))\n\nTo assess bush fire impact, we will also need to download a fifth raster layer that maps the area burnt over the 2019-2020 bushfires:\n\n5.  Fire extent and severity mapping (2019-2020) (from the [NSW government](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/fire-extent-and-severity-mapping-fesm-2019-20))\n\nEach raster layer will need to be wrangled so that they fit neatly together (same area, same projection, same resolution). We will perform a common series of modifications to each layer that generally fall into the following steps:\n\n-   **Crop** the layer to our study area\n-   **Mask** (or remove) the ocean from our layer so that it does not skew our model\n-   **Rename** the layer to something sensible\n-   **Resample** each layer to the same resolution (so that every layer's grid aligns correctly)\n\nThese steps might not always be in the same order, but you will recognise them as we go through the next few sections to download our spatial data.\n\n#### Elevation\n\nFirst we'll download elevation data for our defined region using the `{elevatr}` package's handy `get_elev_raster()` function. By passing our bounding box `bbox_sf` to the `locations` argument we can return elevation data (in metres) for our specified area!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Download elevation raster\nelevation_data <- get_elev_raster(locations = bbox_sf, \n                                  z = 9, \n                                  prj = \"EPSG:4326\")\n\n# Remove raster information outside of the aus land boundary\nelevation_aligned <- elevation_data |>\n  terra::rast() |>      # convert to SpatRaster class\n  terra::mask(aus) |>   # remove information outside of aus boundary\n  terra::crop(bbox_ext) # crop layer to bbox\n\n# Rename layer for simplicity\nnames(elevation_aligned) <- \"elevation\"\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = elevation_aligned, aes(fill = elevation)) +\n  scale_fill_terrain_c(na.value = NA) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title = \"Elevation (m)\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Elevation in metres](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Tree cover\n\nNext we'll download tree cover data. This tree cover raster layer contains satellite data from [Hansen et al (2010)](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/global-2010-tree-cover-30-m) where tree cover is recorded as a percentage (`0` = no cover and `100` = complete tree cover).\n\nSpatial data are held on the [Global Land Analysis and Discovery website](https://glad.umd.edu/). Tree cover data files are divided in tiles of 10 x 10 latitude/longitude. Because our study area crosses over two tiles (`30S_150` and `30S_140`), we will need to download and stitch together two rasters. We can then crop them down to our specified area.\n\nTo download the files, go to the [global 2010 treecover dataset](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/global-2010-tree-cover-30-m) --\\> click on the url link under the **Data Links** subheading near the bottom of the page --\\> click on the relevant data links to download. The two file names we are interested in are: `treecover2010_30S_140E.tif` and `treecover2010_30S_150E.tif`. Save these files in your local working directory.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Use code to download</summary>\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following code chunk to download files:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndownload.file(\"https://glad.umd.edu/Potapov/TCC_2010/treecover2010_30S_140E.tif\", destfile=\"treecover2010_30S_140E.tif\")\ndownload.file(\"https://glad.umd.edu/Potapov/TCC_2010/treecover2010_30S_150E.tif\", destfile=\"treecover2010_30S_150E.tif\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n</details>\n\nLet's load our files into R as rasters.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the raster\ntree_cover_150 <- terra::rast(here(\"treecover2010_30S_150E.tif\"))\ntree_cover_140 <- terra::rast(here(\"treecover2010_30S_140E.tif\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we can crop them to our study area and merge them together.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Crop to bbox\ntree_cover_150_cropped <- tree_cover_150 |> terra::crop(bbox_ext)\ntree_cover_140_cropped <- tree_cover_140 |> terra::crop(bbox_ext)\n\n# Merge\ntree_cover <- merge(tree_cover_150_cropped, tree_cover_140_cropped)\n\n# Rename for simplicity\nnames(tree_cover) <- \"treecover\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collape=\"true\"}\n##### Best practice\n\nWhen working with spatial data we tend to use up a lot of memory! That's a big reason why we are performing these cropping steps---so that we can use up the least amount of memory necessary to get our model to function. Because of this, after we have stitched our two rasters together, we should safely delete the other two as we will no longer require them to clear space.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We can now safely delete the first two raster files to save memory\nrm(tree_cover_140); rm(tree_cover_150)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = tree_cover, aes(fill = treecover)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1, begin = 0.8, end = 0.1) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title = \"Tree Cover (%)\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Tree cover (%)](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Temperature & precipitation\n\nNext we’ll download two bioclimatic raster layers from [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/). CHELSA hosts climate projections at high resolutions intended for ecological use ([here's the paper about it](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.122)). Climate projections extend from 1981 to 2100. Vegetation that greater gliders inhabit is sensitive to temperature and precipitation changes, so we decided to use climate projections for 2011-2040 for the following two climate variables:\n\n-   BIO1: Mean Annual Temperature\n-   BIO12: Annual Precipitation\n\nTo download these layers on the [CHELSA website](https://chelsa-climate.org/), click on 'Downloads' in the top bar, under version 2.1 click the 'Download' button, then navigate to `GLOBAL/*` --\\> `climatologies/` --\\> `UKESM1-0-LL` --\\> `ssp370/` --\\> `bio/`.

The point was to allow users to see what the output even looks like if it runs correctly.\n-->\n\nFinally, we will download a fire extent raster layer, documenting the area burnt by the 2019-2020 bushfires in New South Wales. The NSW Government’s [Fire Extent and Severity Mapping (FESM) 2019/20 dataset](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/fire-extent-and-severity-mapping-fesm-2019-20) contains information on the extent and severity of burnt areas across the state.\n\nTo download, navigate to the [NSW Government website](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/fire-extent-and-severity-mapping-fesm-2019-20), click on 'Dataset Packages', then select the download icon next to 'FESM v3-data in IMG and TIFF format'.

Reprojecting the entire file to `WGS84` (like we have for other rasters) will take up a lot of processing time and memory if we do this reprojection as a first step.\n\nTo save time and memory, let's use an alternative method of cropping first and reprojecting second. We'll first crop `fire_extent` to our desired study area by taking our original `bbox_ext` object and matching its projection to the CRS of `fire_extent`. We'll use `bbox_ext_gda94` to crop `fire_extent` to a much smaller area. Then, second, we can reproject our `fire_extent_cropped` object to the correct projection (and crop again to be certain our layer matches with other layers).\n\nFirst let's convert our bounding box `bbox_ext`, convert it to a polygon and reproject that polygon to use the CRS of `fire_extent`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert bbox to polygon with new projection that matches fire_extent\nbbox_ext_gda94 <- bbox_ext |> \n  terra::as.polygons(\n    crs = gliders_sf           # set crs to match glider data\n    ) |>\n  terra::project(fire_extent)  # reproject crs to match fire_extent\n\nbbox_ext_gda94\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\n class       : SpatVector \n geometry    : polygons \n dimensions  : 1, 0  (geometries, attributes)\n extent      : 9432876, 9664886, 4021704, 4305054  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\n coord. ref. : GDA94_NSW_Lambert \n```\n\nNow we can use our new bounding box `bbox_ext_gda94` to crop `fire_extent` to our study area, then reproject it to our desired CRS `WGS84`. When complete, you'll notice the `extent` and `coord. ref.` or `fire_extent_cropped` have changed to match our expected bounding box and CRS.\n\n::: callout-warning\n##### This process takes a while to run\n\nThe next few steps to crop and reproject `fire_extent` takes \\~5 minutes to run.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Crop fire_extent using the reprojected bbox, then reproject to WGS84\nfire_extent_cropped <- fire_extent |>\n  terra::crop(bbox_ext_gda94) |>\n  terra::project(crs(gliders_sf))   # reproject to match glider data\n\nfire_extent_cropped\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 26110, 26732, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 9.962733e-05, 9.962733e-05  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4563, 151.1196, -37.54717, -34.9459  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource      : spat_38b02a6426e6_14512_80Q6udnsxVen2Mq.tif \nname        : Layer_1 \nmin value   :       0 \nmax value   :       5 \n```\n\nIf there are a few tailing decimal places that appeared while converting the `extent` of `fire_extent_cropped`, we can crop it again using `bbox_ext` to make sure it matches other rasters (the `extent` will slightly but noticeably change).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfire_extent_cropped <- fire_extent_cropped |>\n  terra::crop(bbox_ext)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe'll now mask out the ocean like we did for other layers.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Remove ocean\nfire_extent_cropped <- fire_extent_cropped |>\n    terra::mask(aus)\n\nfire_extent_cropped\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarname     : cvmsre_NSW_20192020_ag1l0 \nname        : fire_extent \nmin value   :           0 \nmax value   :           5 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Save your cropped layer\n\nNow would be a good time to save your new cropped raster layer locally. This cropped raster layer is *much* smaller than our original layer, and it will be easier (and faster) to use this smaller layer in a workflow. Just be sure to document where you downloaded the larger file and the process you used to crop it!\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = fire_extent_cropped, aes(fill = fire_extent)) +\n  scale_fill_princess_c(palette = \"america\")  +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title = \"Fire Severity\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fire Severity](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `fire_extent` layer contains information of the fire's severity on a scale from 0 (unburnt) to 5 (extreme). For our purposes, we are mainly interested in whether the area was affected by fire or not, rather than its severity.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Fire severity values\n\nIf you are interested, the `fire_extent` dataset categorises fire severity using the following values:\n\n-   0 - Unburnt (0% canopy and understory burnt)\n-   1 - Reserved (Experimental category, is not used in raster right now)\n-   2 - Low (\\> 10% burnt upderstory, \\>90% green canopy)\n-   3 - Moderate (20-90% canopy scorch)\n-   4 - High (\\> 90% canopy scorched, \\<50% canopy consumed)\n-   5 - Extreme (\\>50% canopy biomass consumed)\n:::\n\nFor simplicity, let's recode `fire_extent` to whether an area is burnt or unburnt and save this info in a new column `burnt`. We'll use a dummy variable to make our results easier to interpret where burnt is `1` and unburnt is `-1`. Then we'll rename the layer.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nburnt_cropped <- fire_extent_cropped |>\n  mutate(\n    # make `burnt` column\n    burnt = case_when(\n      fire_extent >= 1 ~ 1, # burnt\n      fire_extent == 0 ~ -1, # unburnt\n      .default = NA_integer_\n    )\n  ) |>\n  select(-fire_extent) # remove fire_extent column\n\n# Rename for simplicity\nnames(burnt_cropped) <- \"burnt\"\n\nburnt_cropped\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource(s)   : memory\nname        : burnt \nmin value   :    -1 \nmax value   :     1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Match resolution\n\nA final important step is to make sure our layers are projected at the same resolution. Aligning rasters allows for more accurate and reliable results because grid cells won't overlap in unexpected ways (which would affect our model). Typically, the resolution should match the layer with the lowest resolution. In our case, this is `elevation_aligned` layer, which you can see if you print the object to the console and compare with other layers.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nelevation_aligned\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarname     : file6d6488e4000 \nname        : elevation \nmin value   :      -728 \nmax value   :      1901 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's resample each layer to match the resolution of `elevation_aligned` using `terra::resample()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Resample our tree cover to the resolution of the elevation data\ntree_cover <- terra::resample(tree_cover, elevation_aligned)\ntemp <- terra::resample(temp, elevation_aligned)\nprecip <- terra::resample(precip, elevation_aligned)\nburnt <- terra::resample(burnt_cropped, elevation_aligned)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Combine spatial layers\n\nWe can now combine all of our raster layers into one object containing:\n\n-   Elevation\n-   Tree cover\n-   Mean annual temperature (BIO1)\n-   Annual precipitation (BIO12)\n-   Burnt area from the 2019-2020 bushfires\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_rasters <- c(elevation_aligned, tree_cover, temp, precip, burnt)\n\ncombined_rasters\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 5  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarnames    : file6d6488e4000 \n              file6d6488e4000 \n              file6d6488e4000 \n              ...\nnames       : elevation, treecover, temp_bio1, precip_bio12, burnt \nmin values  :      -728,   0.00000,  6.293441,     468.7325,    -1 \nmax values  :      1901,  94.93295, 18.281870,    1358.0767,     1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPhew! That was a lot of data preparation.

We'll use a similar workflow but will spend less time explaining the ins-and-outs of how species distribution modelling works.\n\n### Prepare data\n\nFirst, we will **thin** our data so that there is only one glider observation in any individual grid cell, so that each grid cell contains a \"presence\" or \"absence\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngliders_thin <- tidysdm::thin_by_cell(gliders_sf, \n                                      raster = combined_rasters)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: aside\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Thinned observations](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nNext, we will add *pseudo-absences*[^4] to our data because our glider observations from the ALA are presence-only[^5].\n\n[^4]: Pseudo-absences, also called background points, are points that represent true absences in our data for modelling.

Doing this with `case_when()` allows us to conditionally assign a new category only when there isn't one already (i.e. only for pseudo-absence points).\n\n[^6]: For this analysis, it doesn't really matter whether we have a *perfect* split.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Assign `pre_fire` and `post_fire` categories to pseudoabsences\ngliders_categorised <- gliders_joined |>\n  mutate(\n    fire_period = case_when(\n      # If there is no category already, sample one\n      is.na(fire_period) ~ sample(c(\"pre_fire\", \"post_fire\"),\n                                  size = nrow(gliders_joined),\n                                  replace = TRUE),\n      .default = fire_period\n    )\n  ) |>\n  select(1:2, fire_period, everything()) # reorder\n\ngliders_categorised\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSimple feature collection with 7849 features and 13 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 148.5 ymin: -37.49949 xmax: 150.8305 ymax: -35.00099\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 7,849 × 14\n   class                geometry fire_period elevation treecover temp_bio1\n   <fct>             <POINT [°]> <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 presence (149.5415 -35.71064) post_fire        1111      82.8      11.2\n 2 presence  (149.444 -36.59851) post_fire         920      87.1      11.7\n 3 presence (149.5139 -35.60314) pre_fire         1041      82.3      11.4\n 4 presence (148.9655 -37.19917) pre_fire          994      90        10.5\n 5 presence (150.2896 -35.48085) post_fire         143      90.0      16.9\n 6 presence (149.5631 -35.93422) post_fire         970      71.7      11.5\n 7 presence (149.4088 -36.74284) pre_fire          947      85.4      11.3\n 8 presence (148.8274 -37.13912) pre_fire          979      90        10.5\n 9 presence (150.2758 -35.48776) pre_fire          128      86.4      17.0\n10 presence (149.5228 -35.86793) post_fire        1233      76.5      10.3\n# ℹ 7,839 more rows\n# ℹ 8 more variables: precip_bio12 <dbl>, burnt <dbl>, recordID <chr>,\n#   scientificName <chr>, taxonConceptID <chr>, eventDate <dttm>,\n#   occurrenceStatus <chr>, dataResourceName <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: aside\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Pseudo-absences, assigned to `pre-fire` or `post-fire`](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nTo make the modelled results of our `fire_period` column easier to interpret, let's reformat our categories to a dummy variable format, where `pre_fire` is `-1` and `post_fire` is `1`.

We'll follow the same general steps that we did earlier, building a raster, cropping and matching the resolution of the other layers.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add fire_period as a spatial layer\nfire_period_rast <- gliders_filtered |>\n  select(fire_period) |>\n  terra::vect() |>                   # convert to vector\n  terra::rast() |>                   # rasterise\n  terra::crop(bbox_ext) |>           # crop to bounding box\n  terra::resample(elevation_aligned) # match resolution\n\n# add fire_period data to raster\nterra::values(fire_period_rast) <- gliders_filtered$fire_period\nnames(fire_period_rast) <- \"fire_period\" # Rename for simplicity\n\nfire_period_rast\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarname     : file6d6488e4000 \nname        : fire_period \nmin value   :          -1 \nmax value   :           1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we can join `fire_period_rast` with the other raster layers\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_rasters_complete <- c(combined_rasters, fire_period_rast)\ncombined_rasters_complete\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 2053, 2054, 6  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.001217593, 0.001217593  (x, y)\nextent      : 148.4994, 151.0003, -37.5001, -35.00038  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs \nsource(s)   : memory\nvarnames    : file6d6488e4000 \n              file6d6488e4000 \n              file6d6488e4000 \n              ...\nnames       : elevation, treecover, temp_bio1, precip_bio12, burnt, fire_period \nmin values  :      -728,   0.00000,  6.293441,     468.7325,    -1,          -1 \nmax values  :      1901,  94.93295, 18.281870,    1358.0767,     1,           1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOk!

The highest habitat suitability for greater gliders appears to be along the middle forest area where most of our greater glider observations were located (which makes sense), along with a few larger areas in the upper and lower west, and near the upper coastline.\n\n# Impact of fire\n\nAs the second part of our investigation, we wanted to know whether the 2019/2020 bushfires had an impact on greater gliders. Our hypothesis was that there are *fewer* greater glider occurrences after the fire, and a driver of this effect is that *an area was burnt* during the 2019/2020 bushfires.\n\nTo see the more traditional statistical test results (e.g., estimates, test statistics, p-values), we *could* extract them from our Generalised Linear Model (GLM) which we ran over our tuning process. These types of summary statistics are easier to interpret, but they might not be the best option for us to use. \n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n##### Why can't we use GLM results?\nGeneralised Linear Models fit a straight line of best-fit to the data. As a result, it's possible to return a coefficient that estimates the slope of the line and some test statistics about each variable's importance in the model.\n\nOther models we've run like Maxent and Random Forest models are a little different, though. They use weights to \"penalize\" a model to get a better fitted line; one that isn't just straight, but shaped and curved to better fit the data. This shaped, squiggly line can be represented by a unique equation, not just a coefficient of slope. When asked to return results for models like these, tidymodels returns penalty values (*lambda*) used by the model, not a summary of statistics and *p* values. \n\nWe have to use other packages (like {vip} and {DALEX}) to assess more complex types of models like our complete `gliders_stacked` model.\n:::\n\nTo see what we mean, let's have a look at our GLM results. Before we see them, let's remind ourselves what we are expecting to see given our hypothesis:\n\n-   Fewer occurrences after the fire. This should appear as a significant, positive `fire_period` coefficient.\n-   Fewer occurrences in burnt areas. This should appear as a significant, positive `burnt` coefficient.\n-   An interaction between fire period and burnt area, because burnt areas after fire will have very few records[^multiply].\n\n[^multiply]: To the extent that the combination of an area being `burnt` and `post_fire` might multiply the effect when together.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# See the models that performed best\n# gliders_models_tune |>\n#   rank_results(\n#     rank_metric = \"boyce_cont\",\n#     select_best = TRUE\n#   )\n\n# extract best glm model\nbest_model <- gliders_models_tune |> \n  extract_workflow(id = \"default_glm\")\n\n# use best glm to fit complete `gliders_filtered` data\nfitted <- \n  best_model |> \n  fit(data = gliders_filtered)\n\n# see results\nfitted |>\n  broom::tidy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 5\n  term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  <chr>                   <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)         20.3       1.35         15.0  5.27e- 51\n2 burnt                0.286     0.0408        7.02 2.15e- 12\n3 fire_period         -0.194     0.0362       -5.35 8.61e-  8\n4 elevation           -0.00586   0.000418    -14.0  8.76e- 45\n5 temp_bio1           -0.729     0.0727      -10.0  1.18e- 23\n6 precip_bio12         0.000354  0.000306      1.16 2.48e-  1\n7 treecover           -0.0836    0.00293     -28.5  1.68e-178\n8 burnt_x_fire_period -0.115     0.0359       -3.21 1.32e-  3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen running a model on this many data points, it's generally expected that most variables will be significant. It's easier to look at the size of the effect (i.e. `statistic`) and the estimate & standard error to figure out the direction and certainty of that estimate. The estimates are a little confusing here due to the model using `presence` as the reference level---higher numbers are a stronger prediction of *absence*.\n\nA quick first impression tells us that `fire_period` and `burnt` variables are significant but relatively weak predictors. You might also notice that some variables like `elevation` are very significant in the model but have tiny estimate coefficients. Let's use DALEX to help us understand how this is possible.\n\n### Use DALEX\n\nIf we want to understand more about our more complex stacked model, we can use the [DALEXtra package](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/). DALEX[^8] is a model-agnostic tool for assessing complex models.\n\n[^8]: DALEX stands for mo**D**el **A**gnostic **L**anguage for **E**xploration and e**X**planation. It may be one of the strangest acronyms of all time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DALEXtra)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nDALEX assumes the opposite reference level to tidymodels for our outcome variable `class`. So to make the results of DALEX make sense, we'll need to recode the predicted values of our model to flip the 1's and 0's. We can do this by returning the results of our best model (according to the metric `boyce_cont`), then we can use `extract_mold()` to see the components of the model, extract the outcome values, and recode the 1's and 0's.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get the results of the best fit model\nbest_fit <- fit_best(gliders_models_tune, metric = \"boyce_cont\")\n\n# flip `class` variable coding\nclass_revised <- best_fit |>\n  workflowsets::extract_mold() |> # components of fitted model results\n  purrr::pluck(\"outcomes\") |>     # pluck predicted 'class' from list\n  dplyr::pull() |>                # pull values from tibble\n  case_match(\"pseudoabs\" ~ 1, \"presence\" ~ 0) # recode\n\nclass_revised |> head(30L)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe rest is very straightforward (thank goodness).

This is probably due to the growing number of records each year in the ALA (though the effect is relatively small).\n-   The slight positive estimate of `burnt` suggests fewer records in burnt areas[^burntareas]. However, the effect is pretty small.\n\n[^afterfires]: Based on how our variable is coded, a negative coefficient means that *before* fires, there is a higher likelihood of *absence*.\n\n[^burntareas]: Based on how our variable is coded, a positive coefficient means that in *burnt areas*, there is a higher likelihood of *absence*.\n\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThe 2019-2020 bushfires had a huge impact on the Australian environment. However, it wasn't all negative; across taxonomic groups there was a wide range of [negative *and* positive effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08174-6) from the fire. It might not all be \"doom-and-gloom\" after all, thanks to the resilience of many Australian species to fires.\n\nOur investigation finds that despite the [general negative impact of severe fire on forests](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08174-6), greater gliders may have been less immediately affected in the aftermath of the 2019-2020 fires than other mammals and marsupials. In the short-term, [glider distributions after megafires seem generally stable](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aec.13582). However, other areas in NSW were more [negatively impacted](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR23129), and they may deteriorate over longer periods. Ultimately, factors like the [density of hollowed den trees](https://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/WR06063) may determine how well greater gliders survive after fire, not only the burnt forest area.\n\nTo learn more on ALA Labs, check out these posts on [using tidymodels and tidysdm](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2024-04-30_sdm-tidymodels/) and [mapping multiple overlapping species distributions](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2024-01-25_hex_point_maps/).\n\n<details>\n\n<summary style=\"color: #E06E53;\">\n\nExpand for session info\n\n</summary>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.4.3 (2025-02-28 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2025-04-04\n pandoc   3.2 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package       * version date (UTC) lib source\n broom         * 1.0.7   2024-09-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n DALEX         * 2.4.3   2023-01-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n DALEXtra      * 2.3.0   2023-05-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n dials         * 1.3.0   2024-07-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n dplyr         * 1.1.4   2023-11-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n elevatr       * 0.99.0  2023-09-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n forcats       * 1.0.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n galah         * 2.1.1   2025-02-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.2)\n geodata       * 0.6-2   2024-06-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n ggplot2       * 3.5.1   2024-04-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.3)\n glmnet        * 4.1-8   2023-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n here          * 1.0.1   2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n infer         * 1.0.7   2024-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n lubridate     * 1.9.4   2024-12-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.2)\n Matrix        * 1.7-0   2024-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n maxnet        * 0.1.4   2021-07-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n modeldata     * 1.4.0   2024-06-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n ozmaps        * 0.4.5   2021-08-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n parsnip       * 1.2.1   2024-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n purrr         * 1.0.2   2023-08-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n ranger        * 0.16.0  2023-11-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n readr         * 2.1.5   2024-01-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.3)\n recipes       * 1.1.0   2024-07-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n rsample       * 1.2.1   2024-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n scales        * 1.3.0   2023-11-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n sessioninfo   * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n sf            * 1.0-19  2024-11-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.2)\n spatialsample * 0.6.0   2024-10-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n stacks        * 1.0.5   2024-07-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n stringr       * 1.5.1   2023-11-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n terra         * 1.8-29  2025-02-26 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.3)\n tibble        * 3.2.1   2023-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tidymodels    * 1.2.0   2024-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n tidyr         * 1.3.1   2024-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.3)\n tidysdm       * 0.9.5   2024-06-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n tidyterra     * 0.6.1   2024-06-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n tidyverse     * 2.0.0   2023-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tune          * 1.2.1   2024-04-18 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n workflows     * 1.1.4   2024-02-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n workflowsets  * 1.1.0   2024-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n xgboost       * 1.7.8.1 2024-07-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n yardstick     * 1.3.1   2024-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.4.3/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
