So to get a more accurate estimate of what might live in a specific location (and you already know this), people can't just get the species observations returned in a shapefile. They also need to consider what has potential to live in an area by checking what might live just outside of the area (and therefore might be in our area at a different time in the past or future), and any pressures external to the specific area that might influence their area (imagine a wetland next to an industrial area - what kind of weird weeds might grow there...). \n\nSo adding a buffer doesn't *only* refer to adding a circular buffer around a given area (though that is common). Sometimes it can mean considering biodiversity corridors, where connections to forests or rivers might offer spaces where species or populations can arrive (or exit) a given location (this is called a movement corridor apparently). Importantly, depending on the types of species you are interested in capturing, the relevant buffer size might differ. For example, birds are incredibly mobile so a larger buffer might be required to capture the full diversity of birds. Other things like pollen, spores or invertebrate larvae (ie dragonfly nymphs) can be quite mobile, and can travel to new locations via wind or rivers.\n\nIn other words, we are trying to get across that because each ecosystem is different, people should give some thought about what buffer size is optimal for a given investigation. The effects of this might matter if they are used for modelling, (which is mentioned in the intro but perhaps without context that's a little confusing) or even more so if they are used for area assessments prior to land development. The concepts are not difficult, but their implications might be. Ideally this post could even help start the thinking process with some examples.\n\nAs a suggested structure, I think it would be good to download occurrences or species for an area using a shapefile and summarise what we get. Then we create buffers of different sizes and compare the differences in results. I'm imagining we might capture a few more endangered species and a lot more occurrence records (depending on the area or species). Those differences might be interesting to discuss. I think this does already happen in this article, but the big tables make it difficult to know what I'm meant to be seeing.\n-->\n\n\nBuffers are used in many ecological spaces.  Most notably, they are used in Species Distribution Models to extend the possible range of rare or threatened species to create a better model.<!-- I'm not sure that's exactly true? Pseudo-absences would be used for this purpose rather than a buffer --> They can also be used to capture occurrences or areas which may have been neglected by a user's original data. <!-- Again, maybe not entirely true? I would say they are there to make sure the polygon shape of a sample area doesn't accidentally omit something important, if anything -->\n\nIn this post, we show how to use `{galah-python}`, `{geopandas}`, `{shapely}` and `{matplotlib}` to add a buffer to occurrences of *Kangaroo Paw*, specifically the Red and Green Kangaroo Paw.\n\n<!-- Buffers are often used for occurrences, but also species lists. Do you think we should also see if the overall number of species returned changes when the buffer size changes? Or is that adding too much detail? Alternatively, rather than choosing a single species, we could choose a taxonomic family and work with more occurrence records/species? -->\n\n# Choosing the right taxon\n\n*Kangaroo Paw* is a common name for a number of species, represented by the genus *Anigozanthos*.  They are perennial plants, native to the south-west of Western Australia.  They are unique, bird-attracting flowers which open at the apex with six claw-like structures resembling kangaroo paws, hence their name!\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"}\n<img src=\"https://ala-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/store/6/c/5/f/16392506-5a74-49db-a9ea-82d0a775f5c6/original\" class=\"rounded\"/></img>\n\n<img src=\"https://ala-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/store/6/a/d/a/83d1e77b-a47a-4325-a864-a78f061cada6/original\" class=\"rounded\"/></img>\n\n<img src=\"https://ala-images.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/store/a/1/3/5/974702ca-f7f9-43f9-a815-f702fe51531a/original\" class=\"rounded\"/></img>\n:::\n\n::: figure-caption\nLeft: [*Anigozanthos manglesii* (dhfischer, iNaturalist CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int)](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/c935c0ed-677b-4999-a8a3-9db464ee2b17), Middle: [*Anigozanthos flavidus* (pimelea, iNaturalist CC-BY 4.0 (Int))](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/403633ee-e20d-4697-aa94-4f022833c1d7), Right: [*Anigozanthos pulcherrimus* (Brigham, John, Citizen Science - ALA Website CC-BY-NC 3.0 (AU))](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/233381a1-257b-42d2-9ce4-9e1da7dc0aa3)\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nTo begin, we will look for the number of occurrences for the genus *Anigozanthos*.  To do this, we will first start by loading `galah-python`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport galah\ngalah.galah_config(email=\"your-email-here\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, we will use the `atlas_counts()` function to see a count of the number of occurrences of all species of Kangaroo's Paw in the ALA.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.atlas_counts(taxa=\"Anigozanthos\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   totalRecords\n0          5952\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt is surprising to note that there are only 84 occurrences coming up for all species in this genus!  To ensure that we have the correct name, we will use `search_taxa()` to see if there is anything going on with this genus.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.search_taxa(taxa=\"Anigozanthos\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  scientificName scientificNameAuthorship                                    taxonConceptID   rank  kingdom      phylum         order         family         genus vernacularName   issues\n0   Anigozanthos                  Labill.  https://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2890004  genus  Plantae  Charophyta  Commelinales  Haemodoraceae  Anigozanthos   Kangaroo Paw  noIssue\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you scroll across to the `rank` column that is returned by this function, unfortunately, the search item that comes up for `search_taxa()` is `unranked`, which explains why we are getting very few records!  What we can do now to refine our search is add a higher order of taxonomic classification to our query.  By searching on the ALA species pages, we know that *Anigozanthos* is a genus belonging to the *Haemodoraceae* family.  `galah-python` has an argument to `search_taxa()` called `scientific_name`, which allows the user to disambiguate their query. \n\n<!-- DK: This might be a little confusing? Maybe choose the best way to go about this and stick with that way (rather than offering multiple ways) -->\n\nNow, if we add the extra taxonomic information, we get thte following query:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.search_taxa(scientific_name={\"family\": [\"Haemodoraceae\"],\"genus\": [\"Anigozanthos\"],\"scientificName\": [\"Anigozanthos\"]})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  scientificName scientificNameAuthorship                                    taxonConceptID   rank  kingdom      phylum         order         family         genus vernacularName   issues\n0   Anigozanthos                  Labill.  https://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2890004  genus  Plantae  Charophyta  Commelinales  Haemodoraceae  Anigozanthos   Kangaroo Paw  noIssue\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHere, if we look at the information, we can see that our `scientificName` matches the genus we want, and the rank is now listed as `genus`.  Now, if we get the total record count using this disambiguation:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.atlas_counts(scientific_name={\"family\": [\"Haemodoraceae\"],\"genus\": [\"Anigozanthos\"],\"scientificName\": [\"Anigozanthos\"]})\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   totalRecords\n0          5952\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnother, shorter, way to write this query is by using the `scientificName` and `scientificNameAuthorship` as the taxon name.  To test that we do get the same number of records, we can simply run\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.atlas_counts(taxa=\"Anigozanthos Labill.\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   totalRecords\n0          5952\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Downloading occurrence records\n\nNow that we know the correct genus, we can start to download occurrence records.  Since there are ~6000 records, let's choose a smaller subset to draw buffers around.  Since a breeding program was started in 2007 by Kings Park Botanic and Garden Board to protect the Kangaroo Paw from disease and the impact of climate changes, let's only include occurrence records starting from 2007 onwards.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngalah.atlas_counts(taxa=\"Anigozanthos Labill.\",filters=\"year>=2007\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   totalRecords\n0          2374\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n1936 is a more manageable number.

For our example, we will be using `EPSG:3577`, which is Australian Albers, and a widely used CRS in Australia when one needs to use meters as a unit.  This is likely different around the world, so be sure to check what CRS is right for your area.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ngdf_anigozanthos_manglesii_meters = gdf_anigozanthos_manglesii.to_crs(3577)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, we will be creating five different buffers around our chosen points: 5km, 10km, 15km, 20km, and 25km.  For each buffer radius, we will be adding a circle of the chosen radius around each point.  We will then put them in a `geodataframe` so we can easily convert the buffers back from meters into degrees so they agree with our original points.  Then, we will perform something called a `unary_union`, which is a function in `shapely` that allows you to unify many shapes into one shape object.  We will then be storing this in a dictionary.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nbuffer_shapes = {}\nbuffer_lengths = {\"5km\": 5000, \"10km\": 10000,\"15km\": 15000,\"20km\": 20000,\"25km\": 20000}\nfor length in buffer_lengths:\n  buffers = [row[\"geometry\"].buffer(buffer_lengths[length]) for i,row in gdf_anigozanthos_manglesii_meters.iterrows()]\n  gdf_buffers = gpd.GeoSeries(buffers).set_crs(3577)\n  gdf_buffers_degrees = gdf_buffers.to_crs(4326)\n  union_buffers_degrees = shapely.unary_union(gdf_buffers_degrees)\n  buffer_shapes[length] = union_buffers_degrees\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, we can finally plot the buffers!  Below is a code using the dictionary we just created to run a `for` loop over all the buffers to easily plot them, and also colour them in different colours.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nax = states[states[\"STE_NAME21\"] == \"Western Australia\"].plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.5, facecolor = \"white\", figsize = (12,6))\nax.set_ylim([-34,-27])\nax.set_xlim([114,119])\ncolors = [\"red\",\"orange\",\"green\",\"purple\",\"black\"]\nplt.scatter(anigozanthos_manglesii['decimalLongitude'],anigozanthos_manglesii['decimalLatitude'], c = \"blue\", s = 2)\nfor i,length in enumerate(buffer_lengths):\n  for j,geom in enumerate(buffer_shapes[length].geoms):\n    if j==0:\n      plt.plot(*geom.exterior.xy,c=colors[i],lw=0.5,label=length)\n    else:\n      plt.plot(*geom.exterior.xy,c=colors[i],lw=0.5)\nplt.legend(fontsize=16)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen-inset layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Adding_Buffers_Points_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-7.png){fig-align='center' width=2304}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nWe hope this point has helped make the steps of adding buffers around points on a map clearer and easier.
