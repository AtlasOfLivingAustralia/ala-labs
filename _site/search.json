Frontiers in Environmental Science https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1270247\n\n\n\nPage info\nPrepared by Olivia Torresan\n\n\n\n\n\nThere remains ongoing debate on how reliable citizen science data is within ecological research. This debate often questions the accuracy and viability of long-term data collection within citizen science. One prevalent opinion is that citizen science data is unreliable compared to professionally collected data for ecological research. Those in support of citizen science argue that citizen science data can be made reliable with proper methodological planning.\nIn this paper, O’Reilly et al. (2023) review WaterWatch ACT, a thirty-year citizen science project on water quality and biodiversity, to understand its successes and failures. The authors find that diverging objectives between keen citizen scientists and professional researchers was one major difficulty of using citizen science for research-grade data collection.\nFor example, citizen scientists value independence and data ownership; these objectives can empower volunteers to choose sites and times that work best for them to collect data. However, this freedom can fragment sample sizes and sites, making data less accurate than data from professionally collected, methodologically rigourous research projects. Despite the benefits of added rigour, there are limitations to the amount of data professional researchers can collect, too, usually due to short-term project funding or finite time and resource commitments.\nWaterWatch ACT found that balancing these objectives was key to improving data quality while retaining strong citizen science support for their long-term program. Citizen science has huge potential for regular data collection in ecology. Learning to adapt methods will improve the use, breadth and quality of ecological data into the future."

Chytrid fungus was first discovered in Australia in the 1970’s and is responsible for over 90 frog extinctions globally.\nScheele et al. (2023) use frog data from the Atlas of Living Australia, GBIF and FrogID to compare niches of impacted and un-impacted frogs in Australia. Niches extend on a species current occurrence record and incorporate broader environmental, climatic, and dietary preferences of frogs, as well as their larger ecosystem role.\nThe authors found that chytrid fungus contracted frogs’ ecological niches, restricting many species to niches with conditions less favoured by chytrid fungus. This finding shows how chytrid fungus can shrink niches and fragment populations, limiting overall species genetic diversity—an important means for frogs to fight disease and repopulate.\nScheele et al.’s (2023) research suggests that chytrid fungus may have a lasting impact on the ecological niche of impacted frog species, limiting their suitability to live in areas where they were distributed previously."

A total of 11,578 Jacaranda sightings were used to calculate the time period and intensity of flowering from 2009 – 2019.\nJacaranda’s were found to flower more intensely and for a longer amount of time in warm and dry conditions, but when too hot and dry this trend reversed. With the climate predicted to grow warmer and drier in the future, Jacarandas may find temporary success along Australia’s east coast, but find conditions increasingly difficult in regions like Perth that are already warm and dry."

It is often considered a rural disease, present in animal populations (often pigs and waterbirds) and able to infect humans that interact closely with animal hosts. Urbanisation and agricultural production can increase the risk that humans contract the virus.\nUntil recently Japanese encephalitis was thought to be geographically restricted to Northern Australia, but in 2022, it was found across all the eastern states of Australia and declared nationally significant.\nFurlong and others (2023) used ALA data to obtain occurrence records of both mosquitos and waterbirds. Using ecological niche models, they found the highest risk of human exposure to the virus in coastal Australia—sprawling across the Great Dividing Range and the Murray-Darling Basin. The authors predict that Japanese encephalitis will establish an endemic circulation in Australia, increasing risks to human health."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Amos Smith Olivia Torresan\nDax Kellie\n\n\n\n5 May 2023\nThe dingo (Canis familiaris) is among Australia’s most recognisable species internationally. However, debate continues about whether dingoes are considered invasive or native species.\nDingoes arrived in Australia around 3,000–5,000 years ago, and their rapid dispersal was likely facilitated by humans. Dingoes hold great significance to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In some communities, women and children often took dingoes with them to hunt small game or collect food, regarded as protection from danger.\nIn the present day, dingoes negatively impact livestock producers, especially sheep farmers. To reduce these impacts, landowners and government agencies spend an estimated ~$30 million annually across Australia to control dingo populations. Control methods include using traps, baits and shooting, along with constructing a physical barrier to limit their movement: the Dog Fence (also known as the Dingo Fence).\nThe Dog Fence is a wire fence made to protect from the loss of sheep and livestock; currently, it is the longest fence in the world (5,614 km). Since its construction 80 years ago, the Dog Fence has shaped the landscape of Australia. However, perhaps unintentionally, the Dog Fence has acted as a natural experiment. On the side where dingoes remain present there is more vegetation and fewer invasive species like foxes than on the side where dingoes are absent. The difference between sides of the fence is so distinct that you can even see it from space! Nearly a century later, the Dog Fence has shown the importance of apex predators like dingoes in ecosystems and their benefit to native biodiversity1.\nTo understand the debate about the dingo’s role in Australia’s ecosystems, it’s useful to know the species’ current distribution. Here, we’ll explore where and how often dingo observations are recorded in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) to understand how historical and ongoing differences in attitudes toward dingo conservation affect data collection."

    "text": "Time of year\nNext, let’s investigate what months of the year have more dingo records. Viewing observations over time can show us patterns of when a species is most active. It can also reveal human biases in data collection. We’ll look specifically at observations in Northern Territory and South Australia because these states have the most data. Given the huge temperature gradient between the north and south of Australia, we might expect the timing of dingo observations to differ between NT and SA.\n\nDownload data\nFirst we’ll download observations by month in the Northern Territory by using the month field inside galah_group_by().\n\n# download data\ndingo_NT &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"canis familiaris\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(raw_vernacularName == c(\"Dingo\", \"dingo\"),\n               cl22 == \"Northern Territory\") |&gt;\n  galah_group_by(month) |&gt;\n  atlas_counts()\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   month count\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 6       909\n 2 7       818\n 3 8       771\n 4 9       596\n 5 5       543\n 6 10      526\n 7 4       485\n 8 3       416\n 9 11      368\n10 1       276\n11 2       220\n12 12      205\n\n\nWe’ll use the lubridate::month() function to convert the class of our month column from character to ordered factor.\n\n# format months for plotting\nmonth_NT &lt;- dingo_NT |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    month = month(as.numeric(month), label = TRUE) # format month\n    )\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   month count\n   &lt;ord&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Jun     909\n 2 Jul     818\n 3 Aug     771\n 4 Sep     596\n 5 May     543\n 6 Oct     526\n 7 Apr     485\n 8 Mar     416\n 9 Nov     368\n10 Jan     276\n11 Feb     220\n12 Dec     205\n\n\n\n\nMake bar plot\nNow we can make a bar chart to see observations over the year. We’ll do the same for South Australia, too.\nNorthern Territory’s dingo observations are recorded mainly over winter months (June–August). Alternatively, South Australia’s dingo observations are mainly recorded during autumn months (April–June).\n\n# plot\nbarplot_nt &lt;- ggplot(data = month_NT, \n                     aes(x = month, y = count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#a84830\") +\n  labs(title = \"Northern Territory\", \n       x = \"Month\", \n       y = \"No. of observations\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  pilot::theme_pilot(grid = \"h\")\n\n\n\nCode\n# Northern Territory\nbarplot_nt\n## South Australia\n\n# download data\ndingo_SA &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"canis familiaris\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(raw_vernacularName == c(\"Dingo\", \"dingo\"),\n               cl22 == \"South Australia\") |&gt;\n  galah_group_by(month) |&gt;\n  atlas_counts() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    month = month(as.numeric(month), label = TRUE) # format month\n    )\n\n# plot\nggplot(data = dingo_SA, \n       aes(x = month, y = count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#d89060\") +\n  labs(title = \"South Australia\", \n       x = \"Month\", \n       y = \"No. of observations\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  pilot::theme_pilot(grid = \"h\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this suggest dingoes are more active during winter, or are data collectors surveying during cooler times of the year? The answer might be “both”. One dingo tracking research study found that dingoes are far more active in winter, spending 46% of their day stationary in winter compared to 91% of their day in summer. Similarly, it’s easier for data collectors to survey during winter months when the heat is less extreme. Cooler winter temperatures might allow dingoes and surveyors to be more active, increasing the likelihood of incidental observations."

    "text": "Author\nFonti Kar\nMargot Schneider\n\n\nDate\n11 April 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2019/2020 Australian bushfires had a devastating impact on the natural landscape, threatening our native biodiversity. More than ever, decision makers need curated, open access biodiversity data to help respond effectively to future bushfires.\nOur team at the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) has been working with Invertebrates Australia and CSIRO National Research Collections team to collate biodiversity datasets that can be used for off-the-shelf bushfire assessments. The two datasets contain data on Australian taxonomic groups that are often overlooked and severely affected during bushfires: invertebrates (insects, molluscs, spiders) and vascular plants.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that these datasets are available from CSIRO’s data access portal!\n\nThis post expands on our last post about using convex and alpha hulls to visualise distributions of data-deficient species.\nHere, we show you how to compute a new form of spatial polygon — a concave hull — and use it to represent a species’ range and to calculate the overlap with fire-burned areas (range overlap). Unlike convex hulls, concave hulls have the added flexibility to adjust their tightness to the data (or concavity). This flexibility allows more accurate estimation of species ranges, making it a useful approach to rapidly assess how natural disasters like bush fires affected biodiversity.\n\nDownload data\nFirst we will load the R packages we need:\n\n# install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, here, rmapshaper, sf, ggpointdensity, viridis, ozmaps, concaveman, cowplot, patchwork)\n\nNext, we will go to the Data Access Portal to download the invertebrate and vascular plant datasets.\nClick on the Files tab (under the main title), then the Download button (in the top right corner), and select Download all files as Zip archive. Save this zip file in a local folder inside your current R project and be sure to unzip it.\nNow we can read the curated datasets into R:\n\n# Invertebrates data\ninverts &lt;- read_csv(here(\"your_directory_name\", \"invertebrate.data.03.2023.csv\"))\n\n# Vascular plants data\nvplants &lt;- read_csv(here(\"your_directory_name\", \"vascularplant.data.03.2023.csv\"))  |&gt; \n  rename(latitude = latitude_used, # Rename coordinate variables for consistency\n         longitude = longitude_used)\n\n\n\nOverview of data\nBoth datasets are based on studies that investigated the impact of the Black Summer bushfires and are designed to support future modelling and impact assessments. The invertebrate dataset spans across Australia, whereas the vascular plant dataset is restricted to South-Eastern Australia and contains only species where more than 50% of their range was affected by the 2019/2020 fires.\n Summary of Invertebrate and Vascular Plant Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Taxonomic Group\n      Classes\n      Families\n      Species\n      Records\n    \n  \n  \n    Invertebrates\n46\n2,044\n44,146\n300,987\n    Vascular Plants\n7\n76\n896\n41,572\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nA total of 44,146 invertebrate species and 896 species of vascular plants are represented in these datasets. Below, we’ve attempted to show the geographic range of these data. So much data makes it challenging to visualise all data points and concave hulls at once. As such, we created the concave hull maps (left) below by randomly selecting one invertebrate species from each class and one plant species from each family.\n\n\nCode\n# Identify species that have more than 4 observations \nmore_than_4_obs &lt;- inverts |&gt;

One benefit of using these curated datasets is that they do not contain any duplicates or missing values. This makes data cleaning an easier job!\nHowever, there are still a few steps we need to do before computing concave hulls:\n\nRemove data-deficient species\nFirst, we need to filter out any data-deficient species with fewer than 4 data points because concave hulls are best estimated with at least 4 data points. To do this, we’ll calculate the number of observations for each species, then identify which ones have more than 4 records. Using this list of species, we can extract their data.\n\nmore_than_4_obs &lt;- inverts |&gt; \n  group_by(scientific_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(n_obs = n()) |&gt; \n  filter(n_obs &gt; 4) |&gt; \n  pull(scientific_name)\n\nmore_than_4_obs |&gt; head()\n\n[1] \"Aaaaba fossicollis\"    \"Aaaaba nodosus\"        \"Aades cultratus\"      \n[4] \"Aades griseatus\"       \"Aaroniella rawlingsi\"  \"Abantiades latipennis\"\n\ninverts_subset &lt;- inverts |&gt;\n  filter(scientific_name %in% more_than_4_obs)\n\n\n\nRestrict data to mainland Australia and Tasmania\nThe invertebrate dataset includes records on offshore islands which can drastically skew the shape of a species’ concave hull. For the purpose of this post, we will filter these out and only use records that occur on mainland Australia and Tasmania.\n\nsubset_mainland &lt;- inverts_subset |&gt; \n  filter(latitude &lt; -10, latitude &gt;= -45,\n         longitude &gt;= 113, longitude &lt;= 155) |&gt; \n  select(scientific_name:family, longitude, latitude)\n\n\n\nList columns and nesting occurrence data\nFor the majority of calculations in this post, we will be making use of list columns, a very useful data structure for iterative analyses. You can think of a list column as mini data frames nested within a column by a grouping variable.\nIn this case we are nesting the coordinate data by species, which will make operations at the species level more efficient.\n\ninverts_nest &lt;- subset_mainland |&gt; \n  nest(coords = c(longitude, latitude))\n\ninverts_nest |&gt; \n  print(n = 6)\n\n# A tibble: 16,347 × 4\n  scientific_name       class   family        coords           \n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;list&gt;           \n1 Aaaaba fossicollis    Insecta Buprestidae   &lt;tibble [12 × 2]&gt;\n2 Aaaaba nodosus        Insecta Buprestidae   &lt;tibble [16 × 2]&gt;\n3 Aades cultratus       Insecta Curculionidae &lt;tibble [20 × 2]&gt;\n4 Aades griseatus       Insecta Curculionidae &lt;tibble [5 × 2]&gt; \n5 Aaroniella rawlingsi  Insecta Philotarsidae &lt;tibble [35 × 2]&gt;\n6 Abantiades latipennis Insecta Hepialidae    &lt;tibble [10 × 2]&gt;\n# ℹ 16,341 more rows\n\n\nYou can inspect elements in the list column like this:\n\ninverts_nest |&gt; \n  pluck(\"coords\", 1) |&gt;  # 1 refers to the first element of the list column\n  print(n = 6)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n  longitude latitude\n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      153.    -28.4\n2      151.    -33.8\n3      153.    -31.0\n4      146.    -37.8\n5      153.    -30.3\n6      151.    -33.8\n# ℹ 6 more rows\n\n\nThe biggest change with working with list columns is that you have to iterate across each element. To do this, we will use various functions from the {purrr} package for the next calculation steps.\n\n\n\nSpecies range overlap with fire-burned areas\n\nGet fire layer\nShapefiles for the 2019-2020 fire season are available through the National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.\nClick on Download Data (near the top of the page), then click on NIAFED_v20200623.zip to download the zip file. Save the zip file in your project folder and unzip to retrieve the shapefiles.\nNow we can read the shapefile into R and set the projection to EPSG:4326. To speed up the computation of concave hulls and overlaps, we will remove elevation values and simplify the edges of the fire POLYGON.\n\nfire &lt;- st_read(here(\"your_directory_name\", \"NIAFED_20190701_20200622_v20200623.shp\")) |&gt; \n  st_transform(crs = 4326) |&gt; \n  st_zm() |&gt;  # Remove Z or M values\n  ms_simplify() # Simplify edges of the fire layer\n\n\n\nChoose taxonomic group\nWhile it is possible to calculate range overlap with burned areas for all species in the dataset, it can take a lot of memory and processing time. Instead, we will demonstrate our workflow with — the bee family (Apidae) — as a working example.\n\n# Filter invertebrate data to Apidae\nbees &lt;- inverts_nest |&gt; \n  filter(family == \"Apidae\") \n\n\n\nCompute concave hull\nIn the next steps, we will work through the coordinate data for each species iteratively using map.\nWe will transform each species’ coordinates into an sf object using st_as_sf(), then compute the concave hulls with the concaveman() function. You can adjust the tightness of the hull boundary around a set of points using the concavity argument - the smaller the value, the tighter the hull.

We can then use st_area() to calculate the area (m2) of overlap and convert it into a percentage of each species’ original range so that all species are comparable.\nUsing possibly() with our map() functions allows the calculations to return NA for species that did not overlap with burned areas.

They need ready-to-go data and workflows to assess and manage possible consequences of the catastrophe and any proposed ways to mitigate it. Here, we used curated datasets of Australian invertebrates and vascular plants to illustrate how concave hulls can represent estimate species range and estimate range overlap with natural disasters. We hope our work can aid future assessments of vulnerable species and help prioritise conservation efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement:\n\n\n\nThe work in this post is part of a project titled: Curated biodiversity data for rapid assessment of bushfire impact.

    "text": "Each species has a habitat range where it normally lives and can expect to be found over its lifetime. However, individuals of a species rarely stay in the same spot for long periods of time. Just like us, they react to changes in their environment, interactions with other species, and interactions with other individuals.\nAs a result, it can be useful to see how a distribution of a species changes in space and over time. In marine environments, for example, seemingly small changes in temperature, chemicals and light can result in large changes to a species’ distribution.\nHere we will map the distribution of Nudibranchia around Australia each month as an animated map to see how nudibranch distributions change over the year.\nThis post is inspired by Liam Bailey’s cool (and hilarious) Bigfoot distribution map. You can find his code here."

    "text": "What is an alpha hull?\nLike a convex hull, an alpha hull is also a way to draw the smallest polygon that encloses all the points in a data set. However, alpha hulls differ because they use an alpha parameter to control how tightly the boundary fits around a set of points. This method creates concave, arched edges that fit around occurrence records more tightly. A tighter boundary around our points helps us avoid over-predicting the range of a species.\nTo illustrate, here are three alpha hulls with increasing values for alpha. Notice as the alpha value increases, the tightness of our boundary decreases.\n\n\nCode\n# Compute alpha shapes and store in list column within a tibble\ntibble(\n  alpha_value = c(1, 2, 5),\n  ahull_ls = map(.x = c(1, 2, 5),\n                 .f = ~ dfly_clean |&gt; \n                   select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |&gt; \n                   ahull(alpha = .x)) \n) -&gt; dfly_ahulls\n\n\n# Transform alpha hull to an `sp` object and set map projection to 4326\nset_map_proj &lt;- function(sp_obj){\nsp_obj@proj4string &lt;- sp::CRS(\"EPSG:4326\") \n\nsp_obj\n}\n\ndfly_ahulls |&gt; \n  mutate(ahull_sp = map(.x = ahull_ls,\n                        .f = hull2spatial::ahull2poly),\n         ahull_sp = map(.x = ahull_sp,\n                        .f = set_map_proj)\n         ) -&gt; dfly_ahulls\n\n\n# Transform `sp` object into a `sf` object \ndfly_ahulls |&gt; \n  mutate(ahull_sf = map(.x = ahull_sp,\n                        .f = st_as_sf)\n         ) -&gt; dfly_ahulls\n\n# Transform occurrences into `sf` object for plotting\nst_as_sf(dfly_clean, \n         coords = c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"), \n         crs = 4326) -&gt; dfly_sf\n\n## A function to compose map \nplot_ahull_fun &lt;- function(ahull_sf, title = NULL){\n  p &lt;- ggplot() + \n    geom_sf(data = aus, colour = \"black\", fill = \"white\")  +\n    geom_sf(data = dfly_sf, colour = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  \n    geom_sf(data = ahull_sf, fill = \"orange\", alpha = 0.5) +\n    coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +\n    ggtitle(paste(\"a = \", as.character(title))) +\n    labs(x = \"Longtitude (DD)\", y = \"Latitude (DD)\") + \n    theme_bw(base_size = 12)\n  \n  p\n}\n\ndfly_ahulls |&gt; \n  mutate(ahull_maps = map2(.x = ahull_sf,\n                           .y = alpha_value,\n                           .f = ~ plot_ahull_fun(.x , .y)) \n  ) -&gt; dfly_ahulls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha = 2 is the alpha value we’ve most commonly come across in research, and is the value recommended by the IUCN for various forms of species vulnerability analysis.\nSo, let’s learn how to make the a = 2 plot above!"

    "text": "Map an alpha hull\nTo make an alpha hull, we will rely on the hull2spatial package (developed by Cecina Babich Morrow). This package allows us to convert “ahull” objects into ggplot-friendly objects (to learn more, check out their blog post about the package).\nInstall the package from GitHub using:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"babichmorrowc/hull2spatial\")\nlibrary(hull2spatial)\n\nTo compute our alpha hull, we’ll provide the longitude and latitude coordinates of our data points to the ahull() function, and set alpha = 2. ahull() creates a list object with far more complexity than our convex hull. A nice way to understand the difference is to look at the first 5 rows of the arcs component of our list dfly_ahull, which stores information like the center and radius of each arch in our alpha hull.\n\n# Compute an alpha hull\ndfly_clean |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |&gt; \n  ahull(alpha = 2) -&gt; dfly_ahull\n\n# See first 5 values of `arcs` component of list\ndfly_ahull$arcs |&gt; head(5L)\n\n           c1        c2 r       v.x       v.y       theta end1 end2\n[1,] 144.8341 -39.83458 2 0.3890667 0.9212096 0.009959896    2    4\n[2,] 144.8227 -39.82989 2 0.3508991 0.9364133 0.037253656    4   10\n[3,] 144.7963 -39.82087 2 0.3060905 0.9520024 0.024179028   10   19\n[4,] 144.6001 -39.75170 2 0.3791546 0.9253334 0.002089519   19   25\n[5,] 143.4759 -38.58566 2 0.9341507 0.3568788 0.014707205   25  137\n\n\nNext we’ll transform our alpha hull and occurrence points into spatial objects for plotting.\nThe ahull2poly() function converts our alpha hull to one type of spatial object (an sp object), but we’ll use st_as_sf() to convert our result to an sf object (because it’s easier to plot) and set our map projection to 4326. We’ll do the same for our damselfly occurrence points.\n\n# Transform  `ahull` into spatial object, convert to sf, set coordinates\nhull2spatial::ahull2poly(dfly_ahull) |&gt; \n  st_as_sf() |&gt; \n  st_set_crs(st_crs(aus)) -&gt; dfly_sf_ahull\n\n# Convert occurrence points to `sf` for plotting\ndfly_clean |&gt; \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"), \n           crs = 4326) -&gt; dfly_sf\n\nFinally, we can create our plot!\n\n# Plot the occurrences and alpha hull\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = aus, colour = \"black\", fill = \"white\")  +\n  geom_sf(data = dfly_sf, colour = \"black\", size = 0.5) +  \n  geom_sf(data = dfly_sf_ahull, fill = \"orange\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Alpha hull\") +\n  labs(x = \"Longtitude (DD)\", y = \"Latitude (DD)\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpha hull with filtered observations\nCitizen science data are often excluded from scientific analyses due to poor data quality e.g. rare species can be misidentified by someone who’s not an expert. Although a strict data criteria will reduce the number of data points, we can still compute and plot alpha hulls for the Powdered Flatwing - this is the beauty of them!\nLet’s repeat exactly the same steps as above for generating an alpha hull, but only use a subset of our damselfly observations that comes from specimen data. We can do this by specifying the basisOfRecord with galah_filter().\n\n# Create a vector excluding human observations\ninstitution_only &lt;- c(\"PRESERVED_SPECIMEN\", \"LIVING_SPECIMEN\", \n                   \"MACHINE_OBSERVATION\", \"MATERIAL_SAMPLE\")\n\ngalah_call() |&gt; \n  galah_identify(\"Austroargiolestes calcaris\") |&gt; \n  galah_filter(basisOfRecord == institution_only,\n               profile = \"ALA\") |&gt; \n  galah_select(group = \"basic\") |&gt; \n   atlas_occurrences() -&gt; dfly_specionly\n\nBelow is our alpha hull of our specimen-only damselfly data. You’ll notice that there are two separate hulls in this map! This is another benefit of using an alpha hull over a convex hull. The mathematical constraints of a convex hull mean all points must be contained within a single polygon - this can lead to an over-estimation of a species’ range."

    "text": "Author\nShandiya Balasubramaniam\n\n\nDate\n23 May 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoropleth maps visually summarise how variables (like species richness or population density, for example) vary across geographic areas. These maps require two inputs:\n\na geospatial object with information on regional boundaries\na numerical variable that can be mapped to each geographic unit using colour\n\nHere, I walk through the process of mapping the density of plant records from the ALA to geographic bioregions across Australia, using two colour scales to differentiate between marine and terrestrial records.\n\nGet geospatial and count data\nLet’s start by loading the packages we’ll need.\n\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rmapshaper)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\nNext, we’ll need some regional boundaries. I think the IBRA7 and IMCRA4 bioregions will work nicely for what we’re planning. These boundaries classify Australia’s landscapes and waters into geographically distinct bioregions based on variables like climate, geomorphology, and species information.\nAfter downloading the data, we can read it in using the sf package and check that it looks correct. Here, I’ve also elected to use ms_simplify() from the rmapshaper package to simplify the geospatial features and speed up computation.\n\n# read in IMCRA shapefile\nimcra_shp &lt;- st_read(here(\"posts\", \n                          \"data\",\n                          \"imcra_mesoscale_bioregions\",\n                          \"imcra4_meso.shp\"), \n                     quiet = TRUE) |&gt; \n  ms_simplify(keep = 0.1)\n\n# read in IBRA shapefile\nibra_shp &lt;- st_read(here(\"posts\",\n                         \"data\",\n                         \"IBRA7_regions\",\n                         \"ibra7_regions.shp\"),\n                    quiet = TRUE) |&gt; \n  ms_simplify(keep = 0.1)\n\nAnd finally, let’s get the number of plant records in the ALA using the galah package, grouped by IBRA or IMCRA region. To do this, we need to know what the ALA calls the IBRA and IMCRA layers.\nUsing the search_fields() function, we can determine that the IBRA layer we’re after is called cl1048 and the IMCRA layer, cl966.\n\nsearch_fields(\"IBRA\")\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  id     description                                                 type  link \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;                                                       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 cl3    \"Western Australian Biodiversity Science Research Priority… laye… \"htt…\n2 cl20   \"IBRA 6 Regions Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of A… laye… \"htt…\n3 cl1049 \"IBRA 7 Subregions IBRA 7 Subregions\"                       laye… \"htt…\n4 cl1048 \"IBRA 7 Regions Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for … laye… \"htt…\n\nsearch_fields(\"IMCRA\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  id    description                                                  type  link \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                                        &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 cl966 IMCRA Meso-scale Bioregions IMCRA Meso-scale Bioregions      laye… http…\n2 cl21  IMCRA 4 Regions Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisati… laye… http…\n\n\nTo get counts of records from the ALA, we can pass a query with galah_call() and build our query using pipes.\nWe will specify that we only want plant records matching Plantae or Chlorophyta using galah_identify(), apply the default set of ALA data quality filters to remove poor quality records using galah_filter(), group records by region using galah_group_by(), and finally return the counts of records that match all our criteria with atlas_counts().\n\n# counts in IBRA regions\nibra_counts &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"plantae\", \"chlorophyta\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(profile = \"ALA\") |&gt; \n  galah_group_by(\"cl1048\") |&gt;      # IBRA regions\n  atlas_counts()\n\nhead(ibra_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  cl1048                      count\n  &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Sydney Basin              2510223\n2 South Eastern Highlands   1599342\n3 South Eastern Queensland   884065\n4 NSW North Coast            851489\n5 South East Corner          837845\n6 Murray Darling Depression  773162\n\n# counts in IMCRA regions\nimcra_counts &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"plantae\", \"chlorophyta\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(profile = \"ALA\") |&gt; \n  galah_group_by(\"cl966\") |&gt;      # IMCRA bioregions\n  atlas_counts()\n\nhead(imcra_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  cl966                count\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 Victorian Embayments 26669\n2 Bruny                19768\n3 Shoalwater Coast     19746\n4 Lucinda-Mackay Coast 19347\n5 Central Victoria     19312\n6 Tweed-Moreton        18383\n\n\n\n\nJoin geospatial and count data\nWe now have the two things we need to make a choropleth map:\n\nIBRA/IMCRA boundaries\ncounts of plant records in each region\n\nTo create a plot, we need to combine the geospatial and numeric data. But first, let’s check if the data needs to be tidied.\nAs we’re going to be joining the spatial and count data, we need to be sure that the names of the IBRA/IMCRA regions match in both datasets. To double check that all of our region names match, we’ll use setdiff(). There are no name mismatches when character(0) is returned, but if any region names are returned that means there is a problem somewhere that we need to fix before joining our dataframes.\nWhen we run setdiff(), the IBRA names match perfectly, but there’s a mismatch in two IMCRA names.\n\n# check region names match\nsetdiff(ibra_counts$cl1048, ibra_shp$REG_NAME_7)\n\ncharacter(0)\n\nsetdiff(imcra_counts$cl966, imcra_shp$MESO_NAME)\n\n[1] \"Pilbarra (nearshore)\" \"Pilbarra (offshore)\" \n\n\nReversing the order of IMCRA data frames in setdiff() reveals that that Pilbara is misspelled in the imcra_counts dataset. We can easily change this and confirm both sets of names match before continuing.\n\n# check the reverse for IMCRA names\nsetdiff(imcra_shp$MESO_NAME, imcra_counts$cl966)\n\n[1] \"Pilbara (offshore)\"  \"Pilbara (nearshore)\"\n\n# replace \"Pilbarra\" with \"Pilbara\" \nimcra_counts &lt;- imcra_counts |&gt; \n  mutate(cl966 = str_replace(string = cl966, \n                             pattern = \"Pilbarra\", \n                             replacement = \"Pilbara\"))\n\n# check names match\nsetdiff(imcra_counts$cl966, imcra_shp$MESO_NAME)\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nNow let’s check how our data are distributed so we can decide whether we should scale them with a transformation before plotting. Data skewed too far to the right will not show differences very clearly when they are mapped.\nChecking the distribution of counts in each dataset shows a substantial skew to the right.\n\nhist(imcra_counts$count)\nhist(ibra_counts$count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying a log-transformation to the count data makes the distribution more symmetrical.\n\nhist(log(imcra_counts$count))\nhist(log(ibra_counts$count))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we join the geospatial and numeric data. Along the way, we rename some columns, remove unnecessary columns, calculate counts as a proportion of the area of each region (so we’re plotting density of records, not counts of records), and convert the resulting dataframe into a simple features object.\n\nimcra_join &lt;- imcra_counts |&gt; \n  full_join(y = imcra_shp, by = c(\"cl966\" = \"MESO_NAME\")) |&gt; \n  rename(\"imcra\" = \"cl966\") |&gt; \n  select(imcra, count, AREA_KM2, geometry) |&gt; \n  mutate(density_log10 = log10(count / AREA_KM2)) |&gt; \n  select(imcra, density_log10, geometry) |&gt; \n  st_as_sf()\n\nibra_join &lt;- ibra_counts |&gt; \n  full_join(y = ibra_shp, by = c(\"cl1048\" = \"REG_NAME_7\")) |&gt; \n  rename(\"ibra\" = \"cl1048\") |&gt; \n  select(ibra, count, SQ_KM, geometry) |&gt; \n  mutate(density_log10 = log10(count / SQ_KM)) |&gt; \n  select(ibra, density_log10, geometry) |&gt; \n  st_as_sf()\n\n\n\nMake a map\nFinally, we’ll use the ggnewscale package to apply different colour palettes to the marine and terrestrial data in a choropleth map.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = imcra_join,\n          aes(fill = density_log10),\n          colour = NA) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"IMCRA\",\n                       type = \"seq\",\n                       palette = \"BuPu\",\n                       direction = 1,\n                       labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.1\", \"1\", \"10\"),\n                       guide = guide_colorsteps(direction = \"horizontal\",\n                                                label.position = \"bottom\",\n                                                title.position = \"left\")) +\n  # adds new colour scale\n  ggnewscale::new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_sf(data = ibra_join,\n          aes(fill = density_log10),\n          colour = NA) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(name = \"IBRA\",\n                       type = \"seq\",\n                       palette = \"YlOrBr\",\n                       direction = 1,\n                       labels = c(\"0.1\", \"1\", \"10\", \"100\"),\n                       guide = guide_colorsteps(direction = \"horizontal\",\n                                                label.position = \"bottom\",\n                                                title.position = \"left\")) +\n  # adds a title for both legends\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x = 133, \n           y = -45.5, \n           label = \"No. of records per square km\",\n           size = 6) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(110, 155), ylim = c(-45, -10)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.key.width = unit(12, 'mm'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess!\nOne thing to note is that we didn’t necessarily have to use ggnewscale here; we could just as easily have combined all the data and plotted them on the same map without keeping the IBRA and IMCRA datasets separate. But, i) it’s nice to be able to differentiate marine and terrestrial regions at a glance, and ii) using two legends also makes it clear that there’s a stark difference in the number of plant records for marine and terrestrial regions.\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2023-08-29\n pandoc   3.1.1 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n dplyr       * 1.1.2   2023-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n galah       * 1.5.3   2023-07-01 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n ggnewscale  * 0.4.7   2022-03-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n ggplot2     * 3.4.2   2023-04-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n here        * 1.0.1   2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n htmltools   * 0.5.5   2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.3)\n rmapshaper  * 0.4.6   2022-05-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n sf          * 1.0-9   2022-11-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n stringr     * 1.5.0   2022-12-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.3.1/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

    "text": "Author\nMartin Westgate\n\n\nDate\nFebruary 17 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxonomy is pretty important at the ALA. Every occurrence record in the atlas is linked to a unique taxonomic identifier. These identifiers are themselves drawn from expertly curated taxonomic datasets. This system of classification is so important to our infrastructure that we have a special name for it; the ‘taxonomic backbone’. But what does it look like?\nVisualising trees is not particularly easy for me; I didn’t train in it, and the data structures involved can be a bit complex. More importantly, until recently it was difficult to download detailed taxonomic information from the ALA. Since version 1.3.1 of galah, however, it has been possible to download taxonomic trees using the atlas_taxonomy() function. Let’s have a go at visualising these trees now.\n\nDownloading taxonomic trees\nThe first step is to choose a taxonomic group to represent in tree form. I’ve chosen the chordates (Phylum Chordata) because they aren’t too large a group and the names are fairly well-known. We can specify this within galah using the function galah_identify. The second piece of information we need to supply is how far ‘down’ the tree to travel. I’ve chosen the Order level here using galah_down_to(order); while we could have gone to the Family or even Genus, trying to traverse too many levels (i.e. to Genus or Species) would take a very long time. A full list of accepted ranks can be found by calling show_all_ranks().\n\nlibrary(galah)\nchordate_orders &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"chordata\") |&gt;\n  galah_down_to(order) |&gt;\n  atlas_taxonomy()\n\nThe object returned by atlas_taxonomy is slightly unusual; it uses the data.tree package, meaning that the dataset is literally structured like a tree. This is notably different from other representations of networks, such as you might find in igraph, for example. To get an idea of what the data look like, we can use the inbuilt print method for this data type:\n\nlibrary(data.tree)\nprint(chordate_orders, pruneMethod = \"dist\", limit = 10)\n\n                            levelName\n1  Chordata                          \n2   ¦--Cephalochordata               \n3   ¦   °--Amphioxi                  \n4   ¦       °--... 1 nodes w/ 0 sub  \n5   ¦--Tunicata                      \n6   ¦   ¦--Appendicularia            \n7   ¦   ¦   °--... 1 nodes w/ 0 sub  \n8   ¦   ¦--Ascidiacea                \n9   ¦   ¦   °--... 5 nodes w/ 0 sub  \n10  ¦   °--Thaliacea                 \n11  ¦       °--... 3 nodes w/ 0 sub  \n12  °--Vertebrata                    \n13      ¦--Agnatha                   \n14      ¦   °--... 2 nodes w/ 2 sub  \n15      °--Gnathostomata             \n16          °--... 5 nodes w/ 134 sub\n\n\nThis shows there are three nodes directly beneath Chordata in the taxonomic hierarchy, of which the largest (by number of sub-nodes) is the vertebrates (Vertebrata). There is a lot we could do with this tree; each node contains a unique taxonomic identifer, for example, meaning that we could use individual nodes to make new queries using galah. However, for now a useful task is simply to visualise the structure of the whole tree.\n\n\nGetting plot-ready data\nTaxonomic trees are complex. While all species have a Kingdom, Phylum, Order, Class and Family, there are many intermediate categories that are ‘optional’. In practice, this means that when we convert to a data.frame for plotting, there are a lot of missing values; nodes that apply to some rows but not others.\n\ndf_rank &lt;- ToDataFrameTypeCol(chordate_orders, type = \"rank\")\ndf_rank[10:20,] |&gt; tibble::as_tibble() |&gt; print(max_footer_lines = 2)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 10\n   rank_phylum rank_su…¹ rank_…² rank_…³ rank_…⁴ rank_…⁵ rank_…⁶ rank_…⁷ rank_…⁸\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 Chordata    Tunicata  Thalia… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 2 Chordata    Vertebra… &lt;NA&gt;    Myxini… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 3 Chordata    Vertebra… &lt;NA&gt;    Petrom… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 4 Chordata    Vertebra… Amphib… Gnatho… Lissam… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 5 Chordata    Vertebra… Amphib… Gnatho… &lt;NA&gt;    Labyri… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 6 Chordata    Vertebra… Amphib… Gnatho… &lt;NA&gt;    Salien… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 7 Chordata    Vertebra… Aves    Gnatho… Neogna… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 8 Chordata    Vertebra… Aves    Gnatho… Neogna… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 9 Chordata    Vertebra… Aves    Gnatho… Palaeo… &lt;NA&gt;    Ratitae &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n10 Chordata    Vertebra… Aves    Gnatho… Palaeo… &lt;NA&gt;    Ratitae &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n11 Chordata    Vertebra… Aves    Gnatho… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n# … with 1 more variable: rank_order &lt;chr&gt;, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​rank_subphylum, ²​rank_class, ³​rank_informal, ⁴​rank_subclass, …\n\n\nThese missing values will show up as empty sections in the resulting diagram, which isn’t ideal. Instead, we can build this data.frame so as to place all nodes in order by row, with empty ‘levels’ being placed at the end. This also avoids the problem where ‘unnamed’ ranks are grouped in the same column. To achieve this, we simply choose a different node attribute (level in this case) to supply to the type argument.\n\ndf_level &lt;- ToDataFrameTypeCol(chordate_orders, type = \"level\")\ndf_level[10:20, ] |&gt; tibble::as_tibble()\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 8\n   level_1  level_2    level_3       level_4     level_5 level_6 level_7 level_8\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 Chordata Tunicata   Thaliacea     Salpida     &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 2 Chordata Vertebrata Agnatha       Myxini      Myxini… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 3 Chordata Vertebrata Agnatha       Petromyzon… Petrom… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 4 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Amphibia    Lissam… Anura   &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 5 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Amphibia    Labyri… Temnos… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 6 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Amphibia    Salien… Spheno… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 7 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Aves        Neogna… Accipi… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 8 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Aves        Neogna… Phaeth… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n 9 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Aves        Palaeo… Ratitae Casuar… &lt;NA&gt;   \n10 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Aves        Palaeo… Ratitae Dinorn… &lt;NA&gt;   \n11 Chordata Vertebrata Gnathostomata Aves        Accipi… &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   \n\n\nAnother problem in this dataset is the existence of duplicated taxonomic names. This happens because different authorities place the same taxon in different parts of the tree, and while the ALA tries to clean up these issues, some disagreements remain. The code below assumes that each name is only present once, so we have to remove duplicates to proceed. Fortunately there is a function in package base that flags duplcated values as TRUE and unique values as FALSE. We can use this function to identify rows where order is not unique.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nkeep_rows &lt;- !duplicated(df_rank$rank_order)\ndf_rank &lt;- filter(df_rank, keep_rows)\ndf_level &lt;- filter(df_level, keep_rows)\n\nThe next step is to determine how to represent this structure in a plot. At the moment we can’t do this, because the data are in ‘wide’ format. Instead, we need to reorder our data so that each node/taxon is represented once, and other plotting aesthetics can be added as additional columns. To achieve this, we first convert to ‘long’ format, preserving information like what row and column each taxonomic label was recorded in.\n\ndf_long &lt;- tibble(\n  row = rep(seq_len(nrow(df_level)), ncol(df_level)),\n  level = rep(seq_len(ncol(df_level)), each = nrow(df_level)),\n  taxon = do.call(c, df_level)) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(taxon)) # remove missing values\n\nThen, we can summarize this plot so that each row is a single taxon, recording some metadata about rows and columns from the original dataset\n\ndf_plot &lt;- df_long |&gt;\n  group_by(taxon) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    xmin = min(row) - 1, \n    xmax = max(row), \n    ymin = level[1] - 1,\n    ymax = level[1])\n     \ndf_plot\n\n# A tibble: 161 × 5\n   taxon             xmin  xmax  ymin  ymax\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Acanthopterygii     61    74     6     7\n 2 Accipititrifomes    15    16     5     6\n 3 Accipitriformes     19    20     4     5\n 4 Actinopterygii      56    96     4     5\n 5 Agnatha             10    12     2     3\n 6 Albuliformes        57    58     6     7\n 7 Amphibia            12    15     3     4\n 8 Amphioxi             0     1     2     3\n 9 Amphioxiformes       0     1     3     4\n10 Anguilliformes      58    59     6     7\n# … with 151 more rows\n\n\n\n\nDrawing\nOur dataset now contains all the information we need to plot the structure of our taxonomic tree. As usual, we’re going to plot this with ggplot2.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(df_plot) +\n  geom_rect(\n    mapping = aes(\n      xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, \n      group = taxon,\n      fill = ymax),\n    color = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is (probably) accurate, it’s not very informative. The most obvious missing element is labels; to add these, we’ll need to determine which nodes are ‘leaves’, and which are ‘branches’. We’ll also want to restrict labelling to larger branches, to avoid the text looking crowded. Finally, there is no need to label leaves with both a rectangle and text; so we’ll remove the leaf rectangles from the plot.\n\ndf_plot &lt;- df_plot |&gt; mutate(\n  x_dist = xmax - xmin,\n  is_leaf = taxon %in% df_rank$rank_order)\n\np &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(\n    data = filter(df_plot, !is_leaf),\n    mapping = aes(\n      xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, \n      group = taxon,\n      fill = ymax),\n    color = \"white\")\n\np +\n  # branch labels\n  geom_text(\n    data = filter(df_plot, x_dist &gt; 5),\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = xmin + (x_dist * 0.5), \n      y = ymin + 0.5,\n      label = taxon),\n    color  = \"white\",\n    size = 3) +\n  # leaf labels\n  geom_text(\n    data = filter(df_plot, is_leaf),\n    aes(x = xmin + 0.5, y = ymin, label = taxon),\n    angle = 90,\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 2.5,\n    color = \"grey20\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is better, but not ideal. A much more pleasing look is to use coord_polar() to generate a circular plot; but this leads to linear text on a circular plot, which looks messy. Fortunately, the new package geomtextpath solves this problem. All we have to do is replace geom_text with geom_textpath, leaving all other code the same, and add coord_polar() at the end.\n\nlibrary(geomtextpath)\n\np &lt;- p + \n  geom_textpath(\n    data = filter(df_plot, x_dist &gt; 5),\n    mapping = aes(\n      x = xmin + (x_dist * 0.5), \n      y = ymin + 0.5,\n      label = taxon),\n    color  = \"white\",\n    size = 2.7) +\n  geom_textpath(\n    data = filter(df_plot, is_leaf),\n    aes(x = xmin + 0.5, y = ymin, label = taxon),\n    angle = 90,\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 2.3,\n    color = \"grey20\") +\n  coord_polar()\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can add some finishing touches by changing the color scheme, hiding the background colors and legend, and resizing the y axis so all the labels are visible.\n\nlibrary(viridis)\n\np +\n  scale_fill_viridis(begin = 0, end = 0.9, direction = -1) +\n  lims(y = c(0, 9)) +\n  theme_void() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! This is a fun plot, but there are ways it could be expanded or improved, the most obvious of which is to find ways to add supplementary information. Wouldn’t it be great, for example, to add leaf-level record counts as marginal barplots? Or scale the size of segments to the number of records, rather than the number of clades? While none of these are impossible, I’m going to leave this here for now. I hope you like the result!\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19044)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2023-03-29\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package      * version date (UTC) lib source\n data.tree    * 1.0.0   2020-08-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n dplyr        * 1.1.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n galah        * 1.5.2   2023-03-20 [1] Github (AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah@1b35520)\n geomtextpath * 0.1.1   2022-08-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n ggplot2      * 3.4.1   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n htmltools    * 0.5.4   2022-12-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n sessioninfo  * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n viridis      * 0.6.2   2021-10-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n viridisLite  * 0.4.1   2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.2.2/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

If you want a “complete” list, go and check out Emil Hvitfeldt’s list of palettes here; but in practice there are only a few that we use routinely. Our default at ALA labs is to use viridis for continuous scales, because (to quote their CRAN page) it’s color-blind friendly, perceptually uniform, and pretty. The default purple-green-yellow color scheme is lovely, but I’m a big fan of ‘magma’, which has a black-purple-orange-yellow scheme\n\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n\n# Get field code for states/territories\nsearch_fields(\"state\") # layer: cl22 OR stateProvince\n\n# A tibble: 26 × 4\n   id      description                                               type  link \n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 cl3     \"Western Australian Biodiversity Science Research Priori… laye… http…\n 2 cl938   \"Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone - Tri State Fruit Fly Exclusio… laye… http…\n 3 cl927   \"States including coastal waters States (including coast… laye… http…\n 4 cl22    \"Australian States and Territories Australian States and… laye… http…\n 5 cl2013  \"ASGS Australian States and Territories Australian Stati… laye… http…\n 6 cl2009  \"National Native Title Register (NNTR, Determinations of… laye… http…\n 7 cl10900 \"Australia's Indigenous forest estate (2013) v2.0 Austra… laye… http…\n 8 cl10902 \"Forests of Australia (2013) v2.0 Forests of Australia (… laye… http…\n 9 cl10903 \"Tenure of Australia's forests (2013) v2.0 Tenure of Aus… laye… http…\n10 cl11033 \"CAPAD 2020 Terrestrial The Collaborative Australian Pro… laye… http…\n# … with 16 more rows\n\n# Download record counts by state/territory\nrecords &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_group_by(cl22) %&gt;%\n  atlas_counts()\n\n# Add state information back to data frame\nrecords$State &lt;- factor(seq_len(nrow(records)), labels = records$cl22) \n\n# Plot\nggplot(records, aes(x = State, y = log10(count), fill = count)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(option = \"magma\", begin = 0.10, end = 0.95) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nMy default for categorical color schemes is the ‘dark2’ palette from RColorBrewer; but given the subject matter of our work, it’s worth mentioning the wonderful feather package by Shandiya Balasubramaniam, which gives colors based on Australian bird plumage.\n\n# remotes::install_github(repo = \"shandiya/feathers\")\nlibrary(feathers)\n\nrcfd &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_identify(\"Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove\") %&gt;%\n  galah_group_by(cl22) %&gt;%\n  atlas_counts()\n  \nrcfd$State &lt;- factor(seq_len(nrow(rcfd)), labels = rcfd$cl22) \n\nggplot(rcfd, aes(x = State, y = log10(count), fill = State)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal(\"rose_crowned_fruit_dove\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nAll of this is fine, but what if you have a specific image that you want to take colors from? A logical choice is to pick the colors you want using an image editting program, but if we want to try something automated, there are options in R as well.\n\n\nExtracting colors\nNational Eucalypt Day aims to raise awareness about Eucalypts and celebrate their influence on the lives of Australians. In honour of National Eucalypt day, we wanted to created a plot based on occurrences data held in the Atlas of Living Australia, themed using colours from actual Eucalypts.\nWe used this image from a tweet by Dean Nicolle:\n\n\nHappy 'National Eucalypt Day'!The Western Australian gimlet (Eucalyptus salubris) has just been announced as Eucalypt of the Year for 2021. Renowned for its fluted, smooth, shiny, and colourful trunk & branches. pic.twitter.com/pOsufQtxWS— Dean Nicolle (@DeanNicolle1) March 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of Eucalyptus salubris by Dean Nicolle\n\n\nFirst, get observations of the Eucalypt of the Year 2021 from ALA using the galah package. Specifically, we use atlas_counts() to determine how many records of Eucalyptus salubris are held by the ALA:\n\nn_records &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_identify(\"Eucalyptus salubris\") %&gt;%\n  atlas_counts()\n\nHere is what the data look like:\n\nn_records %&gt;% head()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  count\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1   853\n\n\nThen get a color scheme from images of the species in question using the paletter package (which needs to be installed from GitHub) \n\n# remotes::install_github(\"AndreaCirilloAC/paletter\")\nlibrary(paletter)\n\nimage_pal &lt;- create_palette(\n  image_path = \"./data/Dean_Nicolle_Esalubris_image_small.jpeg\",\n  type_of_variable = \"categorical\",\n  number_of_colors = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we downsized the image before running the paletter code, as large images take much longer to process.\n\n\nCreating a plot\nOnce we have this palette, the obvious question is what kind of plot to draw. We could have done a map, but those can be a bit boring. We decided to try something that represented the number of observations we had of this species at ALA, and included color, but was otherwise just a pretty picture that didn’t need to contain any further information. Rather than have a traditional x and y axis, therefore, we decided to try out the igraph package to plot the points in an interesting way.\nFirst, we create a vector containing as many points as we want to display, and distribute our colors among them as evenly as possible\n\n# create a vector to index colours\nrep_times &lt;- floor(n_records / length(image_pal))\n\ncolour_index &lt;- rep(seq_along(image_pal),\n  each = as.integer(rep_times))\n\nThen we can create a network using igraph, and use it to create a layout for our points\n\nlibrary(igraph)\n\ngraph_list &lt;- lapply(c(1:15), function(a){\n  lookup &lt;- which(colour_index == a)\n  return(\n    tibble(\n    from = lookup[c(1:(length(lookup)-1))],\n    to = lookup[c(2:length(lookup))])\n    )\n  })\ngraph_df &lt;- as_tibble(do.call(rbind, graph_list)) %&gt;%     # build matrix\n  tidyr::drop_na() %&gt;%\n  as.matrix(.)\ncolour_graph &lt;- graph_from_edgelist(graph_df)             # create network graph\n\n# convert to a set of point locations\ntest_layout &lt;- as.data.frame(layout_nicely(colour_graph)) # convert to df\ncolnames(test_layout) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\")                      # change colnames\ntest_layout$colour_index &lt;- factor(colour_index)          # add colour_index col\n\nFinally, we draw the plot with ggplot2, removing axes with theme_void()\n\nggplot(test_layout, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = colour_index)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.9) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = image_pal) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it! While I like the effect here, I think the paletter package is best suited to cases where there are large areas of strongly contrasting colors; it’s less ideal for images with subtle color differences. It also doesn’t appear to have been updated lately, which may mean it’s not being supported any more. But I’m happy with this plot, and would definitely consider using it again.\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19044)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2023-03-29\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version    date (UTC) lib source\n dplyr       * 1.1.0      2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n feathers    * 0.0.0.9000 2022-10-11 [1] Github (shandiya/feathers@4be766d)\n galah       * 1.5.2      2023-03-20 [1] Github (AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah@1b35520)\n ggplot2     * 3.4.1      2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n htmltools   * 0.5.4      2022-12-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n igraph      * 1.3.4      2022-07-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n paletter    * 0.0.0.9000 2023-01-10 [1] Github (AndreaCirilloAC/paletter@c09605b)\n sessioninfo * 1.2.2      2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n viridis     * 0.6.2      2021-10-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n viridisLite * 0.4.1      2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.2.2/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

Updates streamline code, and provide more examples of output after each step. More in-text detail has also been added about what is happening at each step.\n\n\nThe Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) holds records of magpie sightings from a number data providers like iNaturalist, eBird and BirdLife Australia. Let’s make a visualisation of Australian Bird of the Year 2018 winner, Magpies, using records held in the ALA.\n\nGetting species occurrences\nAs with any R project, a good first step is to load the required packages.\n\n# packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ozmaps)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(hexbin)\n\nWe will use the {galah} package to download records.\nTo download species occurrence records, the {galah} package requires you to add an email registered with the ALA to galah_config(). If running this code yourself, you will need to add an email using the code below, substituting your email with myemail@email.com. This email address should be registered with the ALA, which you can do here\n\nlibrary(galah)\ngalah_config(email = \"myemail@email.com\")\n\nNow we can download magpie occurrence records by using atlas_occurrences(). Note that we also set our data ‘profile’ to ‘ALA’; this means we only download records that meet some basic data quality standards enforced by the atlas. This is optional, but tends to improve the quality of the data returned. (If you wish to see the data quality filters applied in the ALA profile, use search_all(profiles, \"ALA\") |&gt; show_values())\n\nmagpie_occ &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_identify(\"Cracticus tibicen\") %&gt;%\n  galah_apply_profile(ALA) %&gt;%\n  atlas_occurrences()\n\nRetrying in 1 seconds.\nRetrying in 2 seconds.\nRetrying in 4 seconds.\nRetrying in 8 seconds.\nRetrying in 16 seconds.\nRetrying in 32 seconds.\nRetrying in 60 seconds.\nRetrying in 60 seconds.\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the first few rows of the data we’ve just downloaded:\n\nmagpie_occ %&gt;% head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  recordID        scientificName taxonConceptID decimalLatitude decimalLongitude\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0000032b-8690-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -37.0             145.\n2 0000150d-489d-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -37.9             145.\n3 00001736-1fd8-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -34.8             151.\n4 00001e12-29cf-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -39.6             144.\n5 00001f60-0371-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -35.2             149.\n6 000035cd-c3a1-… Gymnorhina ti… https://biodi…           -37.6             144.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: eventDate &lt;dttm&gt;, occurrenceStatus &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   dataResourceName &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, we’re going to filter records not on the mainland or Tasmania.\n\nfiltered_occ &lt;- magpie_occ %&gt;% filter(decimalLongitude &lt; 155,\n                                      decimalLongitude &gt; 110,\n                                      decimalLatitude &gt; -45,\n                                      decimalLatitude &lt; -10)\n\n\n\nPlotting binned data\nThe easiest way to create a hex map is using the hexbin package. However, because there are some areas that have many more observations than other areas, without standardising our data the result is not very useful.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hex(data = filtered_occ,\n           mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, \n                         y = decimalLatitude), \n           bins = 47, \n           colour = \"white\") +\n  coord_sf(ylim = c(-45, -10), \n           xlim = c(110, 155)) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c(\"#EEECEA\", \"#E06E53\")) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nTo make a more informative hex map, in this case it might be useful to try to create our hexagons manually. We can do this by creating a grid of hexagons, filtering the grid to the outline of Australia, and adding our data of magpie counts to set the fill color of those hexagons.\nTo achieve this, we can first convert the map of Australia provided by ozmaps to the same coordinate system as ALA data.\n\naus &lt;- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)\n\nNext we’ll create a grid of hexagons.\n\ngrid_all &lt;- st_make_grid(aus, \n                         cellsize = 1, \n                         what = \"polygons\", \n                         square = FALSE,\n                         flat_topped = TRUE)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = grid_all)\n\n\n\n\nNow we’ll extract all the hexagons in our full grid that intersect our map of Australia, and filter our grid to only include those hexagons by only keeping the hexagon rows that are returned after running st_intersects().\n\n# extract rows that are within AUS land\nkeep_hexes &lt;- st_intersects(grid_all, aus) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame(.) %&gt;%\n  pull(row.id)\n\n# filter full grid to only hexagon IDs in AUS\noz_grid &lt;- grid_all[keep_hexes]\n\nggplot() + geom_sf(data = oz_grid)\n\n\n\n\nNow to figure out how many magpie observations are within each hexagon. To do this, first we’ll convert our magpie observation points to an sf spatial object and make sure the point projection is the same as our map of Australia. Then we can use st_intersects() again to return a list, where each data.frame within the list shows which hexagon ID each point is within.\n\nmagpie_points_sf &lt;- filtered_occ %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"), \n  crs = st_crs(4326))\n\n\nintersect &lt;- st_intersects(magpie_points_sf, oz_grid)\n\nintersect[5:10]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 69\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 43\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 414\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 31\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 185\n\n[[6]]\n[1] 67\n\n\nWith all points in their own separate data.frame, we can use the wicked-fast table() function from base R to count how many points match each hexagon ID, giving us our point counts! A little renaming and wrangling helps to get our counts in the right format.\n\n# condense counts into tibble\ncounts &lt;- as_tibble(table(unlist(intersect)), \n          .name_repair = \"unique\") %&gt;%\n  rename(\"hex_id\" = 1,\n         \"count\" = 2) %&gt;%\n  mutate(hex_id = as.integer(hex_id)) %&gt;%\n  replace_na(list(count = 0))\n\nWe’ll add our count column from complete_counts to our oz_grid, along with an id column containing the row number. This column will act as a reference column to join with complete_counts. Then we’ll also make sure that oz_grid is an sf object for plotting.\n\noz_grid &lt;- oz_grid %&gt;%\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  full_join(counts,\n            by = join_by(id == hex_id)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf()\n\noz_grid |&gt; head()\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 144.8105 ymin: -44.13203 xmax: 148.5632 ymax: -41.63203\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n                                                            geometry    id count\n                                                       &lt;POLYGON [°]&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 ((146.5425 -43.63203, 146.8312 -44.13203, 147.4085 -44.13203, 147…     1   591\n2 ((145.6765 -43.13203, 145.9652 -43.63203, 146.5425 -43.63203, 146…     2     9\n3 ((147.4085 -43.13203, 147.6972 -43.63203, 148.2746 -43.63203, 148…     3  1598\n4 ((144.8105 -42.63203, 145.0991 -43.13203, 145.6765 -43.13203, 145…     4     6\n5 ((146.5425 -42.63203, 146.8312 -43.13203, 147.4085 -43.13203, 147…     5  9681\n6 ((145.6765 -42.13203, 145.9652 -42.63203, 146.5425 -42.63203, 146…     6    71\n\n\nFinally, let’s build our map! We’ll use scale_fill_gradientn() to add a nice legend, and standardise our data using a log-transformation so that the colours on our map are scaled to be more informative.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = oz_grid, aes(fill = count), size = .01) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c(\"#EEECEA\", \"#E06E53\"), \n                       na.value = \"white\", \n                       trans = \"log10\",\n                       labels = scales::comma_format(),\n                       n.breaks = 6,\n                       guide = guide_colourbar(title = \"Observations\")) +\n  coord_sf(ylim = c(-45, -10), \n           xlim = c(110, 155)) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it! All the extra work does make a difference in this case, providing a better representation of the spread of Mapgies across Australia. Manually constructing hex maps can be useful in other circumstances, too. For example, if we wanted to compare the number of magpies to contextual information within each polygon (such as rainfall or human population data), then manually constructing our own hexagons could help us to combine data from different sources.\nA final point is that we could have achieved the same result by creating polygons first, then querying the ALA for the number of magpie records in each polygon using galah_geolocate(). That’s a bit more challenging, and not worthwhile in this case; but it can be an efficient solution where you require information on more species than there are polygons, for example. You can learn how to do this in this ALA Labs article, if you are interested to learn how!\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'sessioninfo' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2023-12-15\n pandoc   3.1.1 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n dplyr       * 1.1.4   2023-11-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n galah       * 2.0.0   2023-12-11 [1] Github (AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah-R@be472e8)\n ggplot2     * 3.4.4   2023-10-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n hexbin      * 1.28.3  2023-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n htmltools   * 0.5.7   2023-11-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n ozmaps      * 0.4.5   2021-08-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n sf          * 1.0-14  2023-07-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n tidyr       * 1.3.0   2023-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.2)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.3.1/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

This map builds on a previous hex map post, but this time we will use a more unique “grid-to-data” method to download our data, where instead of plotting hexagons over our map after extracting data, we’ll create a grid of hexagons that map to Australia before extracting any data and query the ALA for data for each hexagon. This method is cool because it saves a lot of work wrangling your data to fit your plot later on."

    "text": "Being human plays a big role in the species we observe, when we observe them and where we observe them. In particular, we tend to collect more data in areas that are closer to places we live (or have access to) because there are more opportunities to see species in areas we spend more time in than areas that are far away or inaccessible.\nLarge, public datasets like the Atlas of Living Australia are especially prone to this sampling bias because they largely reflect opportunistic observations rather than systematic monitoring programs. However, not all species observations are affected equally by these biases, and it’s useful to quantify how biased data are before interpreting them.\nThanks to the sampbias package, we can easily quantify and compare the effects of these biases on our data, specifically whether data are influenced by cities, roads, airports and rivers.\nThis post expands on a Twitter thread by Dr Ian Brennan to show how sampling bias affects museum records of reptiles. Dr Brennan is currently a Post Doctoral researcher at the Australian National University (ANU). Check out his website to learn more about him and his cool research."

You can find many shapefiles online from reputable sources. For this example, I’ve downloaded a shapefile of suburb boundaries in the city of Canberra, ACT from the ACT’s open-access map database.\nUsually when you download a shapefile, it is compressed within a zip folder. Save this downloaded zip folder in a local folder inside your current R project. If you need to unzip your folder, you can do so with the following code:\n\nzip_folder &lt;- here(\"folder-name\", \"shapefile-folder-name.zip\")\noutput_dir &lt;- \"folder-name-to-save-unzipped-files\" \nunzip(zip_folder, exdir = output_dir) \n\nNow we load this unzipped shapefile into R. To save space, we’ll remove some complexity from our shapefile polygons with ms_simplify() from the {rmapshaper} package.\nThe actsuburbs shapefile contains both suburb boundaries and “district” boundaries, which can encompass several suburbs. To avoid confusion, we will remove districts using filter(LOC_CLASS != \"District\").

It’s a good idea to standardise your data to avoid this bias.

It might be rainy, it might be too hot, an area might be inaccessible; all of these factors can affect whether people make an observation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on people’s health, behaviour and travel. In Australia, several lockdowns over 2020-2021 imposed restrictions on people’s movements, limiting them to certain activities near their homes. Melbourne experienced the longest continuous lockdown in the world.\nTo what extent did COVID-19 and lockdowns affect the number of species observations people made over that time? Here, we’ll use a highlighted time-series plot to investigate how lockdowns in Melbourne affected the observations of Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans), a taxonomic group frequently seen on walks and outdoor gatherings, compared to previous years.\n\nGet data\nWe’ll start by downloading Anatidae records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Tadorna (Casarca) tadornoides (Tracey Hinton CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int)) Middle: Cygnus (Chenopis) atratus (jpshahady CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int)) Right: Spatula rhynchotis (Annette Green CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int))\n\nFirst, let’s load some packages:\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(pilot) # remotes::install_github(\"olihawkins/pilot\")\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(showtext)\n\nLet’s use the {galah} package to download Anatidae records in Melbourne from years before and during COVID-19.\nSearching with search_all(fields) shows us that {galah} contains Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, which we can use to filter our query.\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"city\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  id      description                                                type  link \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                                                      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 cl10929 PSMA ABS Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (2016) AB… laye… http…\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"city\") |&gt; search_values(\"melbourne\")\n\n• Showing values for 'cl10929'.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  field   category         \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;            \n1 cl10929 GREATER MELBOURNE\n\n\nLet’s build our query to return Anatidae records from GREATER MELBOURNE and use galah_select() to return only the eventDate column.\nYou will need to first provide a registered email with the ALA using galah_config() before retrieving records.\n\n# Add registered email (register at ala.org.au)\ngalah_config(email = \"your-email@email.com\")\n\n\nbirds &lt;-\n  galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"Anatidae\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(\n    cl10929 == \"GREATER MELBOURNE\",\n    year &gt;= 2017,\n    year &lt;= 2021,\n    basisOfRecord == \"HUMAN_OBSERVATION\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  galah_select(eventDate) |&gt;\n  atlas_occurrences()\n\nbirds |&gt; slice_sample(n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   eventDate          \n   &lt;dttm&gt;             \n 1 2018-09-01 14:00:00\n 2 2019-03-28 13:00:00\n 3 2017-10-23 13:00:00\n 4 2021-04-17 14:00:00\n 5 2018-03-26 13:00:00\n 6 2021-10-16 13:00:00\n 7 2021-08-20 14:00:00\n 8 2019-03-29 13:00:00\n 9 2021-10-30 13:00:00\n10 2020-08-25 14:00:00\n\n\nWe’ll then extract the week and year of each date and count the total observations for each week.\n\nbirds_weekly &lt;- birds |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as_date(eventDate),\n         year = year(eventDate),\n         week = week(eventDate)) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 2016) |&gt; # remove stray 2016 records\n  group_by(year, week) |&gt;\n  summarise(week_obs = n())\n\nbirds_weekly \n\n# A tibble: 265 × 3\n# Groups:   year [5]\n    year  week week_obs\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1  2017     1      647\n 2  2017     2      670\n 3  2017     3      665\n 4  2017     4      790\n 5  2017     5      745\n 6  2017     6      580\n 7  2017     7      659\n 8  2017     8      680\n 9  2017     9      575\n10  2017    10      541\n# … with 255 more rows\n\n\nWe want to compare observations recorded in 2020-2021 to previous years, but because we know that contributions to the ALA have increased each year, comparing raw numbers will be an unequal comparison and bias our results.\nTo avoid this, let’s scale our weekly record counts by the total number of Anatidae observations each year. Doing this let’s us compare proportions rather than raw numbers.\nFirst let’s download the total Anatidae records for each year.\n\nbirds_yearly &lt;- \n  galah_call() |&gt;    \n  galah_identify(\"Anatidae\") |&gt; \n  galah_filter(cl10929 == \"GREATER MELBOURNE\", \n               year &gt;= 2017, year &lt;= 2021) |&gt; \n  galah_group_by(year) |&gt;\n  atlas_counts() |&gt;\n  rename(year_obs = count) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |&gt;\n  arrange(-desc(year))\n  \nbirds_yearly\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n   year year_obs\n  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1  2017    37195\n2  2018    48697\n3  2019    47874\n4  2020    48851\n5  2021    57520\n\n\nNow we’ll join birds_yearly with birds_weekly so we can calculate the proportion of records observed each week.

We just need to reorganise them so that they plot correctly.\nTwo columns in birds_mean_prop contain proportional counts for 2020 and 2021. Although there are 52 weeks in a year, both years extend from weeks 1-53 because neither year started or ended exactly at the end of the week — 2020 ended on a Thursday and 2021 ended on a Friday.\n\nwday(ymd(\"2020-12-31\"), label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Thu\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\nwday(ymd(\"2021-12-31\"), label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Fri\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\nThis means that the proportional counts in week 53 of 2020 and week 1 of 2021 are in the same week! We can combine them to better represent the full week’s observations and save the combined count in week 1 of 2021.\n\nbirds_mean_prop &lt;- birds_mean_prop |&gt;\n  rows_update(tibble(week = 1, year_2021 = sum(birds_mean_prop$year_2020[53] + birds_mean_prop$year_2021[1]))) |&gt;\n  rows_update(tibble(week = 53, year_2020 = NA)) # remove 2020's week 53 count\n\nbirds_mean_prop |&gt; slice_head(n = 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n   week year_2020 year_2021 mean_2017_19\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1    0.0283    0.0305       0.0223\n2     2    0.0191    0.0186       0.0221\n3     3    0.0251    0.0202       0.0200\n\nbirds_mean_prop |&gt; slice_tail(n = 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n   week year_2020 year_2021 mean_2017_19\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    51    0.0190 0.0154         0.0171 \n2    52    0.0212 0.0152         0.0190 \n3    53   NA      0.0000348      0.00717\n\n\nTo allow us to plot proportional counts from Jan 2020 to Dec 2021 as one line (105 weeks total), we’ll separate our 2021 proportional counts, revise 2021 week numbers to start from 53, and place them under our 2020 proportions.

To do this we can use geom_rect(), setting the xmin and xmax values to our week_start and week_end columns in lockdowns.

Did people make more observations at the tail end of lockdowns because they were seeking relief from being inside by spending more time by natural ponds and lakes?\nSome evidence from the US found more people were using natural spaces during COVID-19, and time in these spaces lowered depression and anxiety. A New Zealand study found similar results.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis post has detailed how you can use ALA data to explore relationships between record counts and events. Although we can’t make any causal claims from what we see in our plot, making a time-series is a nice way to do some exploratory analysis on a lot of data!\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt)\n os       Windows 10 x64 (build 19044)\n system   x86_64, mingw32\n ui       RTerm\n language (EN)\n collate  English_Australia.utf8\n ctype    English_Australia.utf8\n tz       Australia/Sydney\n date     2023-04-04\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ C:/Program Files/RStudio/resources/app/bin/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n dplyr       * 1.1.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n forcats     * 1.0.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n galah       * 1.5.2   2023-03-20 [1] Github (AtlasOfLivingAustralia/galah@1b35520)\n ggplot2     * 3.4.1   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n ggtext      * 0.1.2   2022-09-16 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n htmltools   * 0.5.4   2022-12-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n lubridate   * 1.9.2   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n pilot       * 4.0.0   2022-07-13 [1] Github (olihawkins/pilot@f08cc16)\n purrr       * 1.0.1   2023-01-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n readr       * 2.1.4   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n showtext    * 0.9-5   2022-02-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n showtextdb  * 3.0     2020-06-04 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n stringr     * 1.5.0   2022-12-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n sysfonts    * 0.8.8   2022-03-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n tibble      * 3.1.8   2022-07-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.1)\n tidyr       * 1.3.0   2023-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n tidyverse   * 2.0.0   2023-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.2)\n\n [1] C:/Users/KEL329/R-packages\n [2] C:/Users/KEL329/AppData/Local/Programs/R/R-4.2.2/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────"

In Australia since European colonisation, around 3,000 species have been introduced.\nWithin the last 200 years over 100 native species have gone extinct, with invasive species labelled as affecting 82% (1,257 of 1,533) of Australia’s threatened taxa in 2018. Since 1960, invasive species have cost the Australian economy at least $390 billion in damages, and are now considered a main driver of extinctions in native plants and animals.\nHowever, species from outside of Australia aren’t the only ones that can encroach on other species’ habitats. Native Australian species can do it, too. Thanks in part to human activity, changing temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events, some Australian species have established themselves in new areas outside of their native range. Although not as popularly discussed, Australian species that have become pests in new habitats can disrupt ecosystems much like internationally invasive species.\nIn this post, we will use Python and the {galah} package to visualise how distributions of both international invasive species and native introduced pest species have shifted over time. To do this, we will use alpha shapes to visualise the distribution of Rhinella marina (Cane toads) since the 1930s and create a choropleth map to visualise the expanded habitat range of Pittosporum undulatum.\n\nInvasive Species\n\nDownload data\nTo start, we will use the infamous example of the cane toad to illustrate how far an invasive species’ distribution can spread each decade.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRhinella marina (Isaac Clarey CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int))\n\nFirst load the required Python packages.\n\nimport galah\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas\nimport numpy as np\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport alphashape\nfrom flexitext import flexitext\n\nNext, we will use the {galah} package to download occurrence records of cane toads in Australia from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).

Because galah.atlas_occurrences() returns a Pandas dataframe, we have plenty of functions we can use to clean our data.\n\ncane_toads = cane_toads.dropna(subset=[\"eventDate\", \"decimalLatitude\", \"decimalLongitude\"])\n\nWe want to map cane toad’s distribution each decade in our final visualisation. However, the eventDate value for each record is formaatted as a string value yyyy-mm-dd Thh:mm:ssZ. Let’s write our own function convert_date_to_decade() that extract the year from a date string and return its corresponding decade by rounding down to the nearest decade.\n\ndef convert_date_to_decade(value):\n    date = parse(value)\n    return date.year - (date.year%10)\n\nWe’ll create our new decade column by mapping each record’s date value in eventDate to its corresponding decade value.\n\ncane_toads[\"decade\"] = cane_toads[\"eventDate\"].map(convert_date_to_decade)\n\n\n\nMake Australia map\nNext, let’s download a shapefile of Australia with state boundaries. The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides digital boundary files from which you can explore many other Australian shapefiles. Download the States and Territories - 2021 - Shapefile a zip folder. Save the zip folder inside your working folder and then unzip it to access the .shp file inside.\n{GeoPandas} is a package that handles geospatial data in Python and can be used to load in shapefiles as GeoPandas dataframes. Let’s test this out by plotting our Australian state boundary shapefile.\n\nmpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 1200 # generate a high resolution image\nstates = geopandas.read_file(\"Australia_state_boundaries/STE_2021_AUST_GDA2020.shp\")\nstates.plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.5, facecolor = \"white\")\n\n\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate alpha shapes\nAlpha shapes can be used to define and visualise the shape of a set of species occurrence points in space. They are useful because they can be generated on data-deficient species with few available observations, and without using environmental data or complex algorithms. Let’s use alpha shapes to see how cane toads’ distribution has changed each decade since they were introduced.\nFirst, we need to obtain a list of all decades with cane toad observations. We’ll use the decade column from our cane_toads dataframe to group our observations.\n\ndecades = list(set(cane_toads[\"decade\"]))\n\nWe will be using the {alphashape} package to create alpha shapes representing the cane toad distribution for each decade they have been observed. The alphashape.alphashape() function requires two things:\n\nA set of observation coordinates\nAn alpha parameter, which sets how tightly the shape’s lines conform to our observations\n\nLet’s make an alpha shape for each decade’s observations. We’ll also add a slight buffer to each alpha shape to smooth out some of its edges. Then we’ll group all the shapes into one large GeoPandas dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe used alpha = 1, but it’s good practice to change this parameter depending on how widely distributed the coordinates of your data are. Also note that alphashape.alphashape() requires at least 3 data points to calculate an alpha shape.\n\n\n\nalpha_shape_gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame() # GeoPandas data frame to contain all alpha shapes\nfor i, d in enumerate(decades):\n    decade_points = cane_toads[[\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"]] [cane_toads[\"decade\"] == d]\n    if len(decade_points) &lt;= 3: \n        continue\n    alpha_shape = alphashape.alphashape(decade_points, 1)\n    d = {\"decade\": d, \"geometry\": [alpha_shape.buffer(0.2)]}\n    tmp_gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(d, crs=\"EPSG:7844\")\n    alpha_shape_gdf = pd.concat([alpha_shape_gdf, tmp_gdf])\n\nNext, let’s clean up our GeoPandas dataframe so that it is ready for plotting! Sometimes the alphashape.alphashape() algorithm will produce an empty shape that needs to be removed from the dataframe (this generally happens when the chosen alpha parameter is not appropriate for the supplied set of points). Let’s remove these shapes from our data.\n\nalpha_shape_gdf = alpha_shape_gdf[~alpha_shape_gdf[\"geometry\"].is_empty]\n\nNow let’s format our decade string to display correctly on the figure legend by making sure it’s in YYYYs format.\n\nalpha_shape_gdf[\"decade_string\"] = alpha_shape_gdf[\"decade\"].map(lambda d: str(d) + \"s\")\n\nFinally, because we expect cane toad distributions in earlier decades to be smaller than in recent decades, we’ll need to plot earlier distributions on top of later distributions to avoid covering the earlier ones up. To achieve this, let’s order the alpha shapes in descending order by decade.\n\nalpha_shape_gdf.sort_values(by='decade', ascending=False, inplace=True)\n\n\n\nMap alpha shape distributions\nFinally, we can plot our alpha shape distributions for each decade onto our map of Australia!\nThis figure showcases the incredible pace of the cane toad’s spread across northern Australia. Our map shows that cane toads have spread across most of Queensland, the top end of the Northern Territory (from the 1980s to 2010s) and more recently, into the Kimberley region of Western Australia.\n\nax = states.boundary.plot(edgecolor=\"#5A5A5A\", linewidth=0.5, facecolor=\"white\", zorder=-1)\n\nalpha_shape_gdf.plot(ax = ax, cmap=\"plasma\", column = \"decade_string\", legend=True, categorical=True)\nlgd = ax.get_legend()\nlgd.draw_frame(False)\nlgd.set_bbox_to_anchor((1.2, 0.8))\n\ntitle_text = \"&lt;style: italic&gt;Rhinella marina&lt;/&gt;

However, even Australia’s native species can become pests when introduced to a new ecosystem.\nOne good example of native pests are the trees Pittosporum undulatum (sometimes called Sweet Pittosporum). These trees have been introduced as ornamental plants in gardens across Australia because of their sweet-scented flowers and bright berries. Although Pittosporum undulatum’s native range extends from southern Queensland to eastern Victoria, it is now considered an environmental weed in many regions where it has been introduced.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPittosporum undulatum (Chris Clarke CC-BY)\n\nLet’s create a choropleth map to visualise the to visualise the bioregions where Pittosporum undulatum is native and introduced.\n\nDownload IBRA regions\nFirst, let’s download a shapefile of Australia’s bioregions. The IBRA7 bioregions classify areas within Australia that are geographically and ecologically distinct. Download the zip folder, save it in your project directory and unzip it. We can again use the {GeoPandas} package to read in and handle these data.\n\nbioregions = geopandas.read_file(\"IBRA7_regions/ibra7_regions.shp\")\nbioregions.plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.25, facecolor = \"white\")\n\n\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin our bioregions dataframe, the column REG_NAME_7 contains IBRA bioregion names.\n\nbioregions.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREG_CODE_7\nREG_NAME_7\nHECTARES\nSQ_KM\nREC_ID\nREG_CODE_6\nREG_NAME_6\nREG_NO_61\nFEAT_ID\nShape_Leng\nShape_Area\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nARC\nArnhem Coast\n3.335669e+06\n33356.686\n1\nARC\nArnhem Coast\n81.0\nGA_100K_Islands\n52.135362\n2.774143\nMULTIPOLYGON (((136.93863 -14.36548, 136.93790...\n\n\n1\nARP\nArnhem Plateau\n2.306023e+06\n23060.226\n2\nARP\nArnhem Plateau\n82.0\nGA_100K_Mainland\n8.206764\n1.921833\nPOLYGON ((134.08186 -12.32124, 134.09525 -12.3...\n\n\n2\nAUA\nAustralian Alps\n1.232981e+06\n12329.805\n3\nAA\nAustralian Alps\n6.0\nGA_100K_Mainland\n63.337626\n1.242821\nMULTIPOLYGON (((145.75905 -37.67486, 145.76034...\n\n\n3\nAVW\nAvon Wheatbelt\n9.517104e+06\n95171.043\n4\nAW\nAvon Wheatbelt\n70.0\nGA_100K_Mainland\n35.275357\n9.012298\nPOLYGON ((115.48396 -28.30698, 115.48428 -28.3...\n\n\n4\nBBN\nBrigalow Belt North\n1.367453e+07\n136745.325\n5\nBBN\nBrigalow Belt North\n22.0\nGA_100K_Islands\n91.288203\n11.986228\nMULTIPOLYGON (((151.14295 -23.71304, 151.14210...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind bioregions with observations\nWe’ll once again use {galah} to find numbers of Pittosporum undulatum in each bioregion. First, let’s find which field ID corresponds to bioregions in {galah}\n\ngalah.search_all(fields = \"IBRA\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ndescription\ntype\nlink\n\n\n\n\n486\ncl3\nWestern Australian Biodiversity Science Resear...\nlayers\n\n\n\n495\ncl20\nIBRA 6 Regions Interim Biogeographic Regionali...\nlayers\n\n\n\n536\ncl1049\nIBRA 7 Subregions IBRA 7 Subregions\nlayers\n\n\n\n537\ncl1048\nIBRA 7 Regions Interim Biogeographic Regionali...\nlayers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like field cl1048 contains IBRA 7 regions. Let’s check what values this field contains by using galah.show_values().\n\ngalah.show_values(field = \"cl1048\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield\ncategory\n\n\n\n\n0\ncl1048\nSouth Eastern Queensland\n\n\n1\ncl1048\nSydney Basin\n\n\n2\ncl1048\nSouth Eastern Highlands\n\n\n3\ncl1048\nSouth East Coastal Plain\n\n\n4\ncl1048\nMurray Darling Depression\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n84\ncl1048\nCentral Arnhem\n\n\n85\ncl1048\nIndian Tropical Islands\n\n\n86\ncl1048\nLittle Sandy Desert\n\n\n87\ncl1048\nGibson Desert\n\n\n88\ncl1048\nCoral Sea\n\n\n\n\n89 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nNow we can use the group_by argument in galah.atlas_counts() to group observations of Pittosporum undulatum by bioregion, returning all bioregions where Pittosporum undulatum has been observed at least once. We’ll extract extract and save the bioregion names in a dataframe.\n\nfound_bioregion_counts = galah.atlas_counts(\"Pittosporum undulatum\",\n                                           group_by=\"cl1048\",\n                                           expand = False)\n\n# extract bioregion names from Pandas dataframe into list\nfound_bioregions = list(found_bioregion_counts[\"cl1048\"])\n\nprint(found_bioregion_counts[0:10])\n\n                     cl1048  count\n0              Sydney Basin   9649\n1  South East Coastal Plain   3163\n2         South East Corner   2916\n3   South Eastern Highlands   2766\n4           NSW North Coast   2299\n5  South Eastern Queensland   1083\n6      Flinders Lofty Block    412\n7   Southern Volcanic Plain    345\n8        Victorian Midlands    192\n9       Brigalow Belt South    167\n\n\n\n\nSeparate native & introduced regions\nNext, let’s separate bioregions where Pittosporum undulatum is native from bioregions where it has been introduced. The Australia Native Plants Society estimates Pittosporum undulatum’s native range overlapping with South Eastern Queensland, NSW North Coast, Sydney Basin, South East Corner and South East Coastal Plain (see here). Let’s save these bioregion names in a separate dataframe and compare them to the overall list found_bioregions.\n\nnative_bioregions = [\"South Eastern Queensland\", \"NSW North Coast\", \"Sydney Basin\", \"South East Corner\", \"South East Coastal Plain\"]\nintroduced_bioregions = [region for region in found_bioregions if region not in native_bioregions]\n\nprint(introduced_bioregions[1:5]) # first 5 introduced regions\n\n['Flinders Lofty Block', 'Southern Volcanic Plain', 'Victorian Midlands', 'Brigalow Belt South']\n\n\nNext we can add a new column native to our GeoPandas bioregion dataframe to identify native and introduced regions. We’ll use the .loc method to assign a “Native”, “Introduced” or “No observations” label to each row depending on whether the region is in native_bioregions or introduced_bioregions.\n\nbioregions.loc[bioregions[\"REG_NAME_7\"].isin(native_bioregions), \"native\"] = \"Native\"\nbioregions.loc[bioregions[\"REG_NAME_7\"].isin(introduced_bioregions), \"native\"] = \"Introduced\"\nbioregions[\"native\"] = bioregions[\"native\"].fillna(\"No observations\")\n\n\n\nMake choropleth map\nWhen plotting this GeoPandas dataframe, we can specify that we want the map coloured according to its native label so that native, introduced and not found bioregions are distinguishable colours. This is done by supplying the column argument of the .plot() function with the column of the dataframe that the colouring is based upon. However, matplotlib would choose a default colourmap to colour the bioregions so we will need to specify the exact colours we wanted associated with each type of bioregion.\nTo identify our three categories of regions on our map, we’ll create a new column colour containing colour hex codes for plotting our regions.\n\nbioregions.loc[bioregions[\"native\"] == \"Native\", \"colour\"] = \"#8FBD4C\" # Native\nbioregions.loc[bioregions[\"native\"] == \"Introduced\", \"colour\"] = \"#F7872E\" # Introduced\nbioregions.loc[bioregions[\"native\"] == \"No observations\", \"colour\"] = \"#E4DFCF\" # No observations\n\nWe can use this colour column as the input to our .plot() function.\nOur map shows that Pittosporum undulatum has been observed in Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia, and even Tasmania despite having a fairly narrow native range along the east coast of Australia.\n\nbioregions.plot(edgecolor=\"white\", linewidth = 0.25, color = bioregions[\"colour\"])\n\ntitle_text = \"&lt;style:italic&gt;Pittosporum undulatum&lt;/&gt; &lt;color:#8FBD4C, weight:bold&gt;native&lt;/&gt; and &lt;color:#F7872E, weight:bold&gt;introduced&lt;/&gt; Australian bioregions\"\nflexitext(0.5, 1, title_text, va=\"bottom\", ha=\"center\");\n\nplt.xlim([110, 161])\nplt.ylim([-45, -8])\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nHuman activity—from constructing buildings to travelling overseas to gardening—plays a part in shaping modern ecosystems. Our maps showed how quickly well-known invasive species have established themselves across Australia, and how widely even native Australian plants can spread when introduced to non-native regions.\nHumans are just one of many drivers of introducing species to new areas. Changes to the environment, for example, can shrink available resources and living space in a habitat, giving introduced species a chance to outcompete native species for what resources and space are left. As species inevitably enter and alter ecosystems, large weather events, extreme temperatures and habitat degradation can give invasives a big leg-up on the native competition, too.\nNonetheless, there is still hope. Research finds native species can still adapt to changing environments and simple tasks like pulling weeds can help native species survive after events like fires.\n\n\nExpand for session info\n\n\nimport math\nimport natsort\nimport pandas\nimport session_info\n\nsession_info.show()\n\n\nClick to view session information\n-----\nalphashape          1.3.1\ndateutil            2.8.2\nflexitext           0.2.0\ngalah               0.1.0\ngeopandas           0.12.2\nmatplotlib          3.7.1\nnatsort             8.3.1\nnumpy               1.24.3\npandas              1.5.3\nsession_info        1.0.0\nshapely             2.0.1\n-----\n\n\nClick to view modules imported as dependencies\nPIL                 9.5.0\narrow               1.2.3\nasttokens           NA\nattr                23.1.0\nbackcall            0.2.0\ncertifi             2022.12.07\ncffi                1.15.1\ncharset_normalizer  3.1.0\ncolorama            0.4.6\ncomm                0.1.3\ncycler              0.10.0\ncython_runtime      NA\ndebugpy             1.6.7\ndecorator           5.1.1\ndefusedxml          0.7.1\nexecuting           1.2.0\nfastjsonschema      NA\nfiona               1.9.3\nfqdn                NA\ngoogle              NA\nidna                3.4\nipykernel           6.22.0\nipython_genutils    0.2.0\nisoduration         NA\njedi                0.18.2\njsonpointer         2.3\njsonschema          4.17.3\nkiwisolver          1.4.4\nmatplotlib_inline   0.1.6\nmpl_toolkits        NA\nnbformat            5.8.0\nnetworkx            3.1\nnt                  NA\nntsecuritycon       NA\npackaging           23.1\nparso               0.8.3\npickleshare         0.7.5\npkg_resources       NA\nplatformdirs        3.2.0\nplotly              5.14.1\nprompt_toolkit      3.0.38\npsutil              5.9.5\npure_eval           0.2.2\npvectorc            NA\npydev_ipython       NA\npydevconsole        NA\npydevd              2.9.5\npydevd_file_utils   NA\npydevd_plugins      NA\npydevd_tracing      NA\npygments            2.15.1\npyparsing           3.0.9\npyproj              3.5.0\npyrsistent          NA\npythoncom           NA\npytz                2023.3\npywin32_bootstrap   NA\npywin32_system32    NA\npywintypes          NA\nrequests            2.28.2\nrfc3339_validator   0.1.4\nrfc3986_validator   0.1.1\nrtree               1.0.1\nscipy               1.10.1\nsix                 1.16.0\nstack_data          0.6.2\ntenacity            NA\ntornado             6.3.1\ntraitlets           5.9.0\ntrimesh             3.21.5\nuri_template        NA\nurllib3             1.26.15\nwcwidth             0.2.6\nwebcolors           1.13\nwin32api            NA\nwin32com            NA\nwin32security       NA\nzmq                 25.0.2\nzoneinfo            NA\n\n \n-----\nIPython             8.12.0\njupyter_client      8.2.0\njupyter_core        5.3.0\nnotebook            6.5.4\n-----\nPython 3.11.3 (tags/v3.11.3:f3909b8, Apr  4 2023, 23:49:59) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)]\nWindows-10-10.0.19044-SP0\n-----\nSession information updated at 2023-05-01 13:20"

    "text": "Dax Kellie\nShandiya Balasubramaniam\n\n\n\n28 August 2023\nIn ecology and biology research, box plots are a wonderfully simple and efficient way to summarise data from different groups (e.g., species, populations, experimental conditions). However, this simplicity can sometimes hide the underlying structure of data, unintentionally misleading readers.\nLuckily, there are alternatives to displaying data with box plots, and these options have grown increasingly easy to make in R. This post shows more transparent ways to summarise data, seen through an ecological lens.\nIn our example, we’ll compare several species of plants using a leaf trait commonly used to predict a plant’s performance: leaf dry mass per area (or more simply, the size of a leaf relative to its surface area). We’ll explain how to summarise this trait across a set of species using box plots, and show two ways of also displaying the distribution of the data to be more transparent."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAre plots with bars or boxes any easier to read when oriented up and down (ie. vertically) than side-to-side (ie. horizontally)? You might not have an immediate answer, and so it’s slightly strange (when you think about it) how deep-set the trend of vertical barplots and box plots is in science. Flipping your plot can make longer names easier to read, make group differences easier to spot when stacked in order, and give space to other elements in your plot!↩︎\nFun fact: “How to make it rain” is an actual subheading in the paper↩︎\nIf you would like to add mean and confidence intervals (rather than median and quantile intervals) to your raincloud plot, you can use stat_pointinterval() to do this. However, {ggdist} calculates confidence intervals using a Bayesian method to find point estimates and Highest Density Intervals (HDI). This method returns different estimates to Frequentist confidence intervals, so it’s worth looking up the difference before using HDIs. If you are plotting estimates after running a model, the suggested way by the creator of {ggdist} is to pass this information using dist_student_t() and model parameters from broom::tidy() output. This stack overflow thread we found helpful for getting started.↩︎"

Making a quick and simple map of species observations is especially useful when first investigating where a species has occurred. Viewing locations of points can also help to understand the extent of your data (and spot possible errors or outliers).\nIn this post, we will use either Python or R to make a map of observations of Peron’s tree frog (Litoria peronii) in New South Wales since 2018 recorded by FrogID."

It’s recommended to use search_taxa() to check whether a taxonomic search returns what you were expecting (even if you know the scientific name)!

This is good practice before downloading occurrence records because you can check exactly how many records you are intending to download (and avoid an accidental massive download)!\nWe’ll use atlas_counts() to download record counts, specifying the taxon using the taxa argument, and narrowing the year range, state/territory and data resource using the filters argument.\n\ngalah.atlas_counts(                      # *Download record counts*\n    taxa=\"litoria peronii\",              # *of Peron's tree frog*\n    filters=[\"year&gt;=2018\",               # *since 2018*\n             \"cl22=New South Wales\",     # *in New South Wales*\n             \"dataResourceName=FrogID\"]  # *by FrogID*\n)\n\n   totalRecords\n0         27647\n\n\nNow we can use atlas_occurrences() to download occurrence records, which returns each observation’s location coordinates and event date.\nYou will need to first provide a registered email with the ALA using galah_config() before retrieving records.\n\ngalah.galah_config(email = \"your-email-here\")\nfrogs = galah.atlas_occurrences(\n    taxa=\"litoria peronii\",\n    filters=[\"year&gt;=2018\",\n             \"cl22=New South Wales\",\n             \"dataResourceName=FrogID\"]\n)\nfrogs\n\n\n\n       decimalLatitude  decimalLongitude             eventDate   scientificName                                     taxonConceptID                              recordID dataResourceName occurrenceStatus\n0           -37.246800        149.375000  2020-12-27T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  a5cd2fcd-5225-4d19-977c-b16ca5e8f1dd           FrogID          PRESENT\n1           -37.089036        149.699526  2020-12-14T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  eebde5ef-cac4-4897-af00-cb2e39a0684f           FrogID          PRESENT\n2           -37.077693        149.874402  2018-01-06T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  35340478-97c1-48a4-a463-991fe3a8daa0           FrogID          PRESENT\n3           -37.077241        149.874787  2018-01-06T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  a7abc9f3-362f-469e-9076-5b55a2447b69           FrogID          PRESENT\n4           -37.070746        149.896011  2020-12-13T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  1cc9dda8-f2d4-4f55-acf6-11c93b26da9e           FrogID          PRESENT\n...                ...               ...                   ...              ...                                                ...                                   ...              ...              ...\n27642       -28.207514        153.442592  2018-11-15T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  b094fed1-5bff-4df8-b556-cabd693c533a           FrogID          PRESENT\n27643       -28.207472        153.442497  2018-11-15T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  5cc24fbd-8c6b-4a76-9b28-fec76ee08f37           FrogID          PRESENT\n27644       -28.207442        153.442328  2020-02-07T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  61aa50a1-4c79-4fc3-b3ab-93538faa37b1           FrogID          PRESENT\n27645       -28.207108        153.443021  2021-02-19T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  0324b8d1-77b0-4bf3-9ec2-6ad9efff18f2           FrogID          PRESENT\n27646       -28.186157        153.445556  2018-11-16T00:00:00Z  Litoria peronii  https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/c584f24b-...  bcf83a54-a900-4265-960a-9436356a7107           FrogID          PRESENT\n\n[27647 rows x 8 columns]"

Download the “States and Territories - 2021 - Shapefile” zip file, and save the zip file in the same folder you are coding in.\nLet’s load our States and Territories shapefile with read_file() and save it as states. Then, we will filter the shapefile to New South Wales and quickly plot it (specifying that the edges are black, the inside is white, and the figure size is 12 x 6 inches).\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\n# Load Australian state and territory boundaries\nstates = gpd.read_file(\"STE_2021_AUST_GDA94.shp\")\n\n# Filter to New South Wales and plot\nstates[states[\"STE_NAME21\"] == \"New South Wales\"].plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.5, facecolor = \"white\", figsize = (12,6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur shapefile has plotted nicely, but there are many different ways to display our shape of NSW, which exists on a spherical globe (the Earth), onto a flat surface (our map). Our shapefile already has a projection, determined by its Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of GDA94.\n\n# see the details of our shape's CRS\nnsw.crs\n\n&lt;Geographic 2D CRS: EPSG:4283&gt;\nName: GDA94\nAxis Info [ellipsoidal]:\n- Lat[north]: Geodetic latitude (degree)\n- Lon[east]: Geodetic longitude (degree)\nArea of Use:\n- name: Australia including Lord Howe Island, Macquarie Island, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk Island.

Reprojecting the CRS of our shapefile allows us to make sure the points of our data align correctly with our shapefile.\n\nnsw = nsw.to_crs(4326)\n\nNow, we will add species observations to our map. First, we will plot our reprojected shapefile. Then, we will overlay a scatter plot using decimalLongitude as your x axis and decimalLatitude as your y axis. We’ll set the colour (c) and adjust the alpha to make our points partially transparent.\n\nnsw.plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.5, facecolor = \"white\", figsize = (12,6))\nplt.scatter(frogs['decimalLongitude'],frogs['decimalLatitude'], c = \"#6fab3f\", alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nFor some final touches (to make the map prettier), we can add a title and remove the border.\nWe’ll add a custom Google font, Roboto, by downloading it from Google Fonts, saving the folder in your current directory, unzipping the folder, and loading it with the matplotlib library.\n\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nfrom matplotlib import font_manager\nfont_files = font_manager.findSystemFonts(fontpaths=\"Roboto/\")\nfor ff in font_files:\n  font_manager.fontManager.addfont(ff)\n\nFor further information or troubleshooting tips for installing Roboto on your computer, this post is an excellent guide, as well as the matplotlib.font_manager documentation.\n\nnsw.plot(edgecolor = \"#5A5A5A\", linewidth = 0.5, facecolor = \"white\", figsize = (12,6))\nplt.scatter(frogs['decimalLongitude'],frogs['decimalLatitude'], c = \"#6fab3f\", alpha = 0.5, label = \"Litoria peronii\")\nplt.suptitle(\"Peron's tree frog\",fontsize=36,font='Roboto')\nplt.title(\"FrogID observations in New South Wales since 2018\",fontsize=28,font='Roboto')\nplt.axis('off')\n\n\n\n(140.0937672995, 160.0147167105, -37.972572696499995, -27.6894786335)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save your plot in your current folder, you can use:\n\nplt.savefig(\"perons_tree_frog_nsw.png\")"

    "text": "Download data\nPeron’s Tree frog is one of the most recorded frog species in the Atlas of Living Australia. Growing up to 7cm in length, it is well-known for its eyes which often look like they have a black cross on them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Litoria peronii (Giverny CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int), Middle: Litoria peronii (debtaylor142 CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int)), Right: Litoria peronii (Ernst Weiher, iNaturalist CC-BY-NC 4.0 (Int))\n\nFirst, let’s load some packages.\n\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(showtext)\n\n\nSearch for taxa\nWhen trying to download data about any species or clade, we can search using search_taxa(). It’s recommended to use search_taxa() to check whether a taxonomic search returns what you were expecting (even if you know the scientific name)! We can check taxonomic information about Peron’s tree frog with search_taxa(), which returns extra details about the species when a match is found.\n\nsearch_taxa(\"Litoria peronii\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 15\n  search_term     scientific_name scientific_name_autho…¹ taxon_concept_id rank \n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Litoria peronii Litoria peronii (Tschudi, 1838)         https://biodive… spec…\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​scientific_name_authorship\n# ℹ 10 more variables: match_type &lt;chr&gt;, kingdom &lt;chr&gt;, phylum &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   class &lt;chr&gt;, order &lt;chr&gt;, family &lt;chr&gt;, genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   vernacular_name &lt;chr&gt;, issues &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\nSearch for fields\nNext, we can search for fields and field IDs for filtering our query. In this case, we are interested in filtering to a specific year, state/territory and data resource.\nWe can start by searching for any fields containing the word “year” using search_all().\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"year\")\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  id                  description            type  \n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt; \n1 year                Year                   fields\n2 raw_year            Year (unprocessed)     fields\n3 endDayOfYear        End Day Of Year        fields\n4 startDayOfYear      Start Day Of Year      fields\n5 occurrenceYear      Date (by decade)       fields\n6 raw_endDayOfYear    &lt;NA&gt;                   fields\n7 raw_startDayOfYear  &lt;NA&gt;                   fields\n8 namePublishedInYear Name Published In Year fields\n\n\nWe can do the same kind of search to find fields with information of australian states/territories and data resource names.\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"states\")\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id       description                            type  \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                                  &lt;chr&gt; \n1 cl2013   ASGS Australian States and Territories fields\n2 cl22     Australian States and Territories      fields\n3 cl927    States including coastal waters        fields\n4 cl10925  PSMA States (2016)                     fields\n5 cl110925 PSMA States - Abbreviated (2016)       fields\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"resource\")\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  id                     description              type  \n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt; \n1 resourceID             Resource ID              fields\n2 dataResourceUid        Dataset                  fields\n3 dataResourceName       Dataset                  fields\n4 relatedResourceID      Related Resource ID      fields\n5 raw_dataResourceUid    Dataset (unprocessed)    fields\n6 raw_dataResourceName   Dataset (unprocessed)    fields\n7 relationshipOfResource Relationship Of Resource fields\n8 resourceRelationshipID Resource Relationship ID fields\n\n\nIf you are ever uncertain which field ID to choose, you can use show_values() to see what possible values are within a field. For example, let’s see what values are in field ID cl22.\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"cl22\") |&gt;\n  show_values()\n\n• Showing values for 'cl22'.\n\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 1\n   cl22                        \n   &lt;chr&gt;                       \n 1 New South Wales             \n 2 Victoria                    \n 3 Queensland                  \n 4 South Australia             \n 5 Western Australia           \n 6 Northern Territory          \n 7 Australian Capital Territory\n 8 Tasmania                    \n 9 Unknown1                    \n10 Coral Sea Islands           \n11 Ashmore and Cartier Islands \n\n\nWe can also search for a value using search_values(), which might be handy to check that “FrogID” is a value in dataResourceName.\n\nsearch_all(fields, \"dataResourceName\") |&gt;\n  search_values(\"FrogID\")\n\n! Search returned 2 matched fields.\n• Showing values for 'dataResourceName'.\n\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 1\n# ℹ 1 variable: dataResourceName &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDownload observations\nNow we are ready to build our query to download observations of Peron’s tree frog in New South Wales since 2018 recorded by FrogID.\nFor those unfamiliar with Australian geography, New South Wales is this one:\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s find the number of records that match our query. This is good practice before downloading occurrence records because you can check exactly how many records you are intending to download (and avoid an accidental massive download)!\nWe’ll use atlas_counts() to download record counts, specifying the taxon using galah_identify(), and narrowing the year range, state/territory and data resource using galah_filter().\n\ngalah_call() |&gt;                                 # Begin a query\n  galah_identify(\"Litoria peronii\") |&gt;          # Peron's tree frog\n  galah_filter(year &gt;= 2018,                    # since 2018\n               cl22 == \"New South Wales\",       # in New South Wales\n               dataResourceName == \"FrogID\") |&gt; # by FrogID\n  atlas_counts()                                # Download record counts\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  count\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1 27647\n\n\nNow we can use atlas_occurrences() to download occurrence records, which returns each observation’s location coordinates and event date.\nYou will need to first provide a registered email with the ALA using galah_config() before retrieving records.\n\ngalah_config(email = \"your-email-here\")\n\n\nfrogs &lt;- galah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_identify(\"Litoria peronii\") |&gt;\n  galah_filter(year &gt;= 2018,\n               cl22 == \"New South Wales\",\n               dataResourceName == \"FrogID\") |&gt;\n  atlas_occurrences()\nfrogs\n\n# A tibble: 27,647 × 8\n   recordID       scientificName taxonConceptID decimalLatitude decimalLongitude\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 0008c41d-fd35… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -33.2             152.\n 2 000c1c20-bec3… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -33.0             150.\n 3 000e46ad-9ace… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -31.3             149.\n 4 001229c0-4c48… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -33.7             150.\n 5 0014b8ff-ddd5… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -33.4             151.\n 6 00183dd1-c9cd… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -36.6             150.\n 7 002088e5-3a73… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -32.1             150.\n 8 002108e1-9933… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -33.7             151.\n 9 00251c30-9dfd… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -34.3             151.\n10 00259fce-87db… Litoria peron… https://biodi…           -30.5             153.\n# ℹ 27,637 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: eventDate &lt;dttm&gt;, occurrenceStatus &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   dataResourceName &lt;chr&gt;"

    "text": "Make a map\nIt’s time to make our map!\nIn order to draw our map of New South Wales, we’ll download a shapefile of the latest state and territory boundaries from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Download the “States and Territories - 2021 - Shapefile” zip file, and save the zip file in the same folder you are coding in.\nLet’s load our States and Territories shapefile with read_file() and save it as states. Then, we will filter the shapefile to New South Wales and quickly plot it to check it plots correctly (specifying that the border is grey, and the inside is white).\n\n# Load Australian state and territory boundaries\nstates &lt;- st_read(here(\"STE_2021_AUST_GDA94.shp\"),\n                  quiet = TRUE)\n\n# Filter to New South Wales\nnsw &lt;- states |&gt; \n  filter(STE_NAME21 == \"New South Wales\")\n\n# Plot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nsw,\n          colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur shapefile has plotted nicely, but there are many different ways to display our shape of NSW, which exists on a spherical globe (the Earth), onto a flat surface (our map). Our shapefile already has a projection, determined by its Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of GDA94.\n\n# see the details of our shape's geometry\nnsw |&gt; st_geometry()\n\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 140.9993 ymin: -37.50516 xmax: 159.1092 ymax: -28.15689\nGeodetic CRS:  GDA94\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((159.0623 -31.50887, 159.0622 -3...\n\n\nTo make it clearer how the CRS changes the projection of a map, here are 3 maps of NSW projected with 3 different CRS:\n\nGDA94 (the current projection of our NSW shapefile)\nEPSG:8058 (a state/territory-specific projection for NSW)\nEPSG:2955 (intended for Canadian territories)\n\n\n\nCode\nnsw |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\")\nnsw |&gt; \n  st_transform(crs = st_crs(8058)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\")\nnsw |&gt; \n  st_transform(crs = st_crs(2955)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDA94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPSG:8058\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPSG:2955\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the ALA use CRS EPSG:4326 (also known as “WGS84”).

First, we will plot our reprojected shapefile. Then, we will overlay a scatter plot using decimalLongitude as your x axis and decimalLatitude as your y axis. We’ll set the colour and adjust the alpha to make our points partially transparent.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nsw,\n          colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\") +\n  geom_point(data = frogs,\n             aes(x = decimalLongitude,\n                 y = decimalLatitude),\n             colour = \"#6fab3f\",\n             alpha = 0.5,\n             size = 1.1)\n\n\n\n\nFor some final touches (to make the map prettier), we can add a centred title and add a minimal theme.\nWe’ll add a custom Google font, Roboto, using the showtext package, loading it into R with font_add_google().\n\n# Add font\nfont_add_google(\"Roboto\")\nshowtext_auto(enable = TRUE)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = nsw,\n          colour = \"grey60\",\n          fill = \"white\") +\n  geom_point(data = frogs,\n             mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude,\n                           y = decimalLatitude),\n             colour = \"#6fab3f\",\n             alpha = 0.5,\n             size = 1.1) +\n  labs(title = \"Peron's tree frog\",\n       subtitle = \"FrogID observations in New South Wales since 2018\") +\n  theme_void() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,          # horizontally centre\n                              family = \"Roboto\",    # add font\n                              size = 31),           # change font size\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5,       # horizontally centre\n                                 family = \"Roboto\", # add font\n                                 size = 25)         # change font size\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save your plot in your current folder, you can use:\n\n# set dpi for text\nshowtext_opts(dpi = 320)\n\n# save\nggsave(here(\"map_perons-tree-frog.png\"),\n       height = 9, width = 10,\n       unit = \"in\",\n       dpi = 320)"

Usually caused by habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation can separate populations from the larger group of individuals.\nCompared to larger populations, fragmented populations are more likely to inbreed, reducing their genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is important for species. It improves their resilience to disease and their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Without detection or management, fragmentation heightens species extinction risk.\nWith the help of ALA data, Hohwieler and others (2022) assessed the genetic diversity of a Queensland koala population by comparing physical samples (ear biopsy specimens and scats) between two generations (2006 vs. 2018).\nThe authors found a decline in diversity that correlated with accelerating urbanisation, traffic increases and habitat loss. Supported by this evidence, the authors call for stronger requirements of genetic diversity guidelines when determining species’ and ecosystems’ critical status by the International Union for Conservation (IUCN)."

The most common way to extract and analyse microfossils is by using a compatible acid to dissolve the rock they are preserved in while leaving the fossil intact. In some cases, though, this method does not work. If the rock matrix and the fossils are too compositionally similar, for instance, the choice of acid can degrade the fossil or reduce its quality.\nFaced with this problem, Djokic and others (2023) used citizen science to analyse images of pollen and spore microfossils from McGrath’s Flat near Gulgong in the Central Tablelands (NSW). Analysing images of microfossils is an incredibly time and resource-consuming feat. A professional scientist usually needs around 6 hours to locate and image 50 microfossils (not including analysis or identification).\nUsing images hosted by Atlas of Living Australia’s online volunteering platform DigiVol, 250 citizen scientists analysed 25,000+ images at three times this pace (!), successfully identifying 300 pollen and spores from the Miocene age (11–20 million-years-ago). The authors hope to encourage other researchers to use the power of citizen science for fossil identification."

However, at the same time, P. radiata is threatened within its native range of California.\nGiven P. radiata’s global popularity, the spread of pests and disease are both a high risk and a prominent concern for this tree. Insects that feed on the foliage or bore the live layer of growing wood and bark are able to stunt growth or even kill P. radiata.\nBrockerhoff et al. used data of insects known to feed on P. radiata, including data from the Atlas of Living Australia, to map each species invasion status and quantify their impact. They found the Americas to have the greatest number of high-impact invasive species, followed by Australia and Asia. Australasia also had the highest number of different native and non-native species to feed on P. radiata overall and the highest number of migratory insect species to other countries.\nKnowing where herbivorous insect pests are common and where they are migrating globally can help inform and improve current biosecurity protocols when importing and exporting pine products in the future."

(2023) Citizen science aids the quantification of the distribution and prediction of present and future temporal variation in habitat suitability at species’ range edges. Frontiers of Biogeography https://doi.org/10.21425/F5FBG58207\n\n\n\nPage info\nPrepared by Olivia Torresan\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies distribution models are widely used in ecology to predict where a species might live. These models can be particularly useful to understand species that are difficult to observe or survey. However, when there is limited data on a species, models are prone to making poor predictions as well.\nCitizen science data can help increase not only the number of observations, but also the breadth of surveillance of many different species. When the range of a species is known to be shifting or expanding, data collected by citizen scientists may be especially useful for gathering up-to-date information because the chance of incidentally observing a species increases.\nLandry et al. (2023) compared species distribution models of Tasmanian species of Snapper and Whiting—two recreationally important fish with expanding habitat ranges—that included or excluded citizen science observations data with traditional data repository observations. They found models that include citizen science data predict a substantially larger habitat range for both species: an increase of 277km for Snapper, and 437km for Whiting. Adding citizen science data also increased the volume of data by 2.3% for Snapper and 52.7% for Whiting. For species with expanding habitat ranges, citizen science data can be useful for capturing occurrences of species at their range edge.\nLandry et al.’s (2023) work demonstrates how citizen science data can be an asset for predicting species distributions of marine species as habitat ranges shift as a result of warming temperatures. Although an expanding habitat range might appear positive for recreational fishing, shifts in habitat range can have negative down-stream effects on ecological dynamics. For example, as waters become warmer, Snapper and Whiting are expected to spawn and settle more successfully in new areas, consuming resources in areas they previously couldn’t survive."
